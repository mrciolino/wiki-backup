# The Early Universe

## Creation of Worlds & Primordial Chaos
- [Spoops](/characters/spoops) awakens alone in **[The Well of Souls](/locations/The-Well-Of-Souls)**. The creation of Souls begins, and AO jams his door shut.
- The universe begins with chaotic primordial energy, birthing the **[Old Gods](/entities/old-gods)**.
- The Old Gods impose order, shaping planets, planes, and celestial structures.

## Rise of the New Gods
- A second generation of gods, more powerful and attuned to order, overthrows the Old Gods.
- Some Old Gods are contained or dispersed; others flee to the **[Far Realms](/locations/far-realms)**.

## Divine Rule & the Birth of Titans
- The New Gods take dominion and prevent another power shift.
- They create **[Titans](/entities/titans)**—lesser godlike beings—to maintain order.
- Spoops opens the floodgates of [The Well](/locations/The-Well-Of-Souls), allowing souls to flow into creation.
- Mortal races emerge, alongside the primordial forces of **Good** and **Evil**.

## The War in Heaven
- The Titans rebel against the New Gods, foreseeing their obsolescence.
- The Titans are defeated; **Kronos**, the most powerful Titan, is sealed in the **[Chains of Karseri](/artifacts/chains-of-karseri)**.
- These chains anchor his prison to the celestial order, including [Mardun](/locations/Mardun).

## The Continuation of Creation
- Gods, Titans, and angels collaborate to populate worlds like **[Mardun](/locations/mardun)**.
- **Magic** emerges as a natural phenomenon, not a divine creation.
- New gods enter the divine system, such as [Zeus](/characters/zeus) and [Bane](/characters/bane).

## Ancient Events

- **Deep Gnome Lore:** *TODO*
- **Fall of the Illithid Empire:** *TODO*
- Spoops spends time under the name Myrkul and adventures as one of the dead 3. The Time of Troubles occurs.

# The Age of Giants (??? BC - ??? BC)
- The race of Giants become the largest and most powerful creatures on [Mardun](/locations/Mardun), their reign spread over Felldora and Felldun.
- Ancient structures are erected and dinosaurs are bred as beasts of burden.

## The Giants vs Dragon war
- Eventually Dragons go to war with the Giants.
- The great Giant leader **Blavog**, who rode a T-rex into battle, lead the final assault against the Dragons, but could not match up to their air superiority.
- The Giants lost, and they became scattered across the world only the be hunted to near extinction or pass their genes off to other races (who became larger after the fact).
- An ancient Cyclopian dungeon in what is now known as the Celestial Vale is shut away, which housed a portal that could lead to potentially anywhere.

# The Age of Dragons (??? BC - ~2100 BC)
- With no creatures on earth left to challenge them, Dragons become the hegemonic power of Mardun. **Cosmos, the Champion of the Skies**, declares to all Mardun that the Age of Dragons has begun. All major powers remaining on Mardun, be they Giant, Orc, Goblin, or Elvish, are under dominion of the Dragons. 
- Dragons migrate to the lands of Dracofell, which becomes a holy land to their kind. Only Dragons, dragonborn, and kobolds may enter it. 
- **2150 BC:** **[Inferno](/characters/inferno)**, who would go on to become the longest living dragon, is born in Dracofell to parents **Blazius** and **Ierris**. 
- **[Darmuth](/characters/darmuth)**'s body begins to form in response to the heightened levels of magic on Mardun.
- **Rise of the [Pythagorean Empire](/organizations/The-Pythagorean-Empire):**  
	- Arcanographers, Astronomers, and Line-walkers pool their knowledge together to discover the existence and paths of the three leylines that exist on Mardun: The leylines of **Vitality**, **Flux**, and **Insight**.
  - The multi-century leyline project, where the three leylines are aligned together, completed and **Pythas Prime** founded at the point of their union.
  - The Arcanomancers of Pythas Price harness **[Runic Magic](/magic/runes)**, the first form of magic that can be harnassed without natural or divine forces. The field that would be known as Wizardry is begun.
  - Asmal, an accomplished Arcanomancer (proto-wizard), is imprisoned in Pythas Prime for his dangerous and heretical ideas concerning the "antipode" powers of Vitality, Flux, and Insight. He is given the title of "*Asmal the Mad*".
  - Dragons from Dracofell, where the antipode of Pythas Prime is located, grow concerned that the new power harnessed by mortals could threaten their strength, and coordinates a massive assault on Pythas Prime. Despite their strength, the Arcanomancers' magic is too primitive to fight off Dragons.

## ~2100 BC: The Desolation of Asmal
- Asmal, the Mad of Pythas Prime, is freed from Pythas Prime after 80 years of captivity during the Dragon assault by a cult of followers who gained interest in his heretical ideas. They decide to make the very long and perilous journey to Dracofell to get revenge on the Dragons.
- Asmal reaches Dracofell undetected, and his thesis is correct that an enormous amount of "negative energy" has built up at the antipode of Pythas Prime. 
- It is unclear the exact method he used, but the result was harnessing a new form of dark magic that lead to the extinction of 99% of dragons on all of [Mardun](/locations/Mardun). All surviving Dragons fled to Wyrmford, as Dracofell became a desolate wasteland hostile to all life. It is unclear what happened to Asmal and his followers, but his actions lead to the creation of dark magic. Such an enormous release of power also shook the leylines from their foundations, setting them free from the restraints setup up by Pythas Prime. Asmal the Mad leaves behind the legacy of the harbringer of dark magic (anti-Vitality, anti-Flux, anti-Insight) to Mardun.
- Without the leylines in place, Pythas Prime falls into ruin and the Pythagorean people flee, spreading the knowledge of magic around Mardun. Being supported on an artificial island by the leyline of Vitality, Pythas Prime sinks into the water, to what is now know as the [Triangle Sea](/locations/triangle_sea).

# The Age of Mortals (~2100 BC - ~1 AC)
- During this period, magic as a discipline develops very rapidly. The primitive runic leylines eventually are replaced by the weave and the major magical schools are formalized. Great sages during this period invent the common and well known spells whose knowledge of are spread throughout Mardun.
- Various survivng factions of the Pythagorean Empire found new settlements.
	- A guild of astronomers travel north to the Celestial Vale and begin a new tradition of studying stars for scrying and fortelling abilities.
  - A guild of warriors travel east to what is now called Helmaer and begin a tradition of magic for combattive purposes.
  - A guild of vitalists travel west to Druidia and the Wild Jungles of the emerald coast to continue their traditions of healing magic, and beast husbandry. Eventually they rediscover giant beasts from the Age of Giants.
	- The few remaining dragons scatter around the earth, forever living in fear of the Desolation of Asmal.

## Rise and Fall of Tiyamanni (1000 BC - 500 BC)

  - Gnomes are driven out from Tiyamanni; they and residents of the Celestial Vale go and found **[Fywick](/locations/fywick)**.

### Collapse of Tiyamanni
Led by Darmuth's cruelty and mismanagement, combined with natural forces, the capital of Tiyamanni is rendered to ruin.

## The Necrotic Wars 

- **90–66 BC:** **[Spoops](/characters/spoops)** washes ashore on [Mardun](/locations/Mardun), becomes Grandmaster of the [Knights of Sedonnya](/organizations/Knights-of-Sedonnya).

    - [Ralindu](/characters/ralindu) and the other Lich lords wage war on the living world. 
- **4 BC:** Spoops washes ashore near **[Witchlight Jungle](/locations/witchlight-jungle)** and makes his way to [Fort Suro](/locations/Mardun/Fort-Suro). Gilthur is exiled from [North Geskoworm](/locations/Mardun/north_geskoworm) for being unfunny, and wanders to [Fort Suro](/locations/Mardun/Fort-Suro).

- On the journey one of the party members stole Spoops' dick (the immovable rod) to play a prank on him, hurting his feelings. In response upon arrival to the city, Spoops sulked by the river, passively summoning snakes because "they are his only real friends who wont hurt him". He was saying things like this to the snakes using his ring of animal communication which made the snakes feel very awkward. Eventually a guard came by and asked if he was doing alright and eventually escorted him to the castle where he met the rest of the party. After a touching moment, they returned his immovable rod and made up.
- The party gets an audience with the king due to them slaying the Devastation Shark Scorpion.

The party defends the caravan from some hostile tribes as they pass through. While talking to some of the centaur's they come across a speaking stone that the centaurs claim their god speaks to them through, the party hears a booming godlike voice coming through it, which they realize is fake. In response they use Dio to locate the source, go to the location and confront the false god. Upon discovering the false god is Fiad up to his old schemes, the party attacks. Fiad pleads for mercy by explaining that he had worked under Darmuth but planned to betray her the whole time because he knew about her loyalities to the Emperor and he believed he could get a better deal. He offered the party power and service under the Emperor, but the party declined his foolish offer and killed him.

- Spoops then works with Bazzdos to create an immense suit of power armor and weapons for Tu'narath. Then the two of them pilot Mecha-Tu'narath in combat against the titan Iaeptus. This results in the destruction of Iaeptus and Mecha-Tu'narath, their corpses and machinery creating a debris field that becomes a ring around Mardun.
- Spoops moves onto his final task, combining all lost fragments of Gond's soul. He scours the universe, finding every last fragment of Gond for which he first scattered to be put within Bazzdos.
- After the war ends and the party departs on various quests, Mortis Lux goes into standby mode. The main Generals, and lieutenants return to Mardun, with the exception of the Saragossa Pirates who stay in space after taking possession of their promised Spelljammer ships. 
- Illiard is made regent of Mortis Lux HQ during the party's absence, and is granted immortality by Spoops. He oversees basic operations and keeps HQ secure with the help of a legion of undead granted to him by Spoops, and a small group of living members. He keeps Mortis Lux's resources and finances active in case the old treaties and armies need to be called upon again. Jergal also hangs out with him sometimes.
- **[Ereriad](/locations/ereriad)'s Fall**: [Bane](/characters/bane) killed Ereriad's major players and took over the world following the [Emperor](/characters/illithid-emperor)'s defeat.
- Many resources were distributed among the member states of Mortis Lux to help in the rebuilding of the many cities destroyed during the war. The flying ships were used for various purposes during the rebuilding. Many of the pilots during the war were clerics of Hastow and Wegate, and they continued to pilot their ships during the reconstruction era. Hastow happened to supply the majority of clerics during the war and so as Narascus began making his villainous moves, Hastow's fleet was the largest.
	- Narascus becomes regent of Hastow.
  - Versrahan becomes regent of Wegate.
  - Luther becomes regent of Altricia.
  - Os and Breeze-e return to Gothriathon.

- Adalynn's fortress becomes inoperable for spelljammer transport (until Illiard takes control back in the future).
- Narascus, forseeing disarray, makes his initial claim to be the successor of Spoops. His claim gains some sympathy from his own clerics, but his claim is challenged by others. Primarily the Wegatians.

### ~10 AC
- Bazzdos sees party fractures taking hold and begins planning to assume control of the gnomish people by emulating the god Gond. He begins creating infrastructure for a massive mining and forge operation in North Geskoworm. He recruits gnomes from all over Mardun to support this operation and establish mining for iron, mithril, and other metals.

### ~14 AC

- With the incredibly fast industrialization of North Geskoworm, it becomes a wealthy trade city and the leading exporter of mithril and mithril goods. The gnomes begin to see Bazzdos as a god of the forge akin to Gond, but just as they begin to worship him, Bazzdos starts seeing them as a means to an end. He begins using gnomes named Gond to collect Gond souls and incorporate them into his own soul core. This leaves many gnomes in a state of having to relearn their world, as a small part of their soul is missing.

### ~15 AC

- Gilthur learns of Bazzdos taking a small part of Gond from the gnomes and confronts him to protect the Gnomish Gonds.
- Bazzdos's first automatons, originally used to run the mining operations, easily take control of North Geskoworm in an occupation that lasts two months. In a final battle of the rebellion, Gilthur and Bazzdos duel, both dealing significant damage to each other. Seeing the people he wished to lead rise against him, Bazzdos retreats into the Forge Dimension.
- The remaining automatons lose coordination due to delays in the speaking stone networks, making them vulnerable to coordinated attacks and are destroyed by the gnomes.
- Gilthur, Hero of North Geskoworm, succumbs to his wounds, and the blessing of Garl Glittergold passes to Krorgfrey.
- As the party crumbles, Bazzdos begins shutting down the speaking stone network, as it is too exposed to the Naracenes.
- Bazzdos starts developing a new, more secure speaking stone network, unconnected to the old system, allowing better control over the automatons and AI robots.
- Bazzdos decides to leave Mardun for a time and travels to the Plane of Fire, where he begins new projects and future plans.

## The Hastow-Wegate War (15-16 AC)
- In an effort to seize power and crush any religious opposition, Narascus uses hundreds of spelljammers to launch a surprise attack on Wegate, and marched his armies over land on Altricia. Altricia falls easily, Luther is captured, and the remaining troops march on Wegate.

### Battle of Wegate
- Narascus bombards Wegate, dropping undead on and outside the less defended city. Undead vs Undead and necrotic magical combat ensue. 
- However, this attack was forseen by the oracle of Fywick who shared this intel with allies of Mortis Lux, who all were prepared to defend Wegate. 2/3 of Hastow spelljammers are destroyed.
- Breezy-e teleports to Narascus' command ship, demanding an explanation for this attack. Narascus almost manages to convince breezy-e that this is the will of Spoops, but to seal the deal that there is nothing suspicious, Breezy-e offers to share a bowl of spaghetti which Narascus hates. This sours his ruse with Breezy-e, leading to a duel where Narascus is defeated. Breezy-e thinks he killed Narascus and commands the fleet to leave. 
- Hastow spelljammer forces are forced to retreat back to Hastow. Breezy-e returns to Os at Gothriathon. 
- The Hastow land force arrive in Wegate and find out Narascus has already been defeated. Most of the living necromancers are persuaded diplomatically to side with Wegate. The turncoats inform Wegate that [Altricia](/locations/Mardun/Allford) is captured and Luther was taken prisoner back in Hastow. The new Wegate army is sent to march back to [Altricia](/locations/Mardun/Allford)

### Preparation for the Counterattack
- Narascus returns via spelljammer and finds Luther and other Altrician nobility imprisoned. Most of his forces are destroyed or turned to Wegate, and he himself is gravely injured. Narascus' body is rejuvinated via a demonic blood ritual where Luther and the other nobles are sacrificed. Narascus arises, empowered anew, and reinvigorated as the Red Archon.
- Wegate begins rebuilding some spelljammers without Bazzdos' assistance. New spelljammers used as aerial support. 
- Os in Gothriathon, having grown distant from Mortis Lux, takes a removed approach from the counterattack. Not willing to die over the remains of Mortis Lux, he only sends Breezy-E. 
- In Bayrhys, learning of the death of Luther in a blood sacrifice, Kierkegaard swears eternal vengance and has sent out forces of elite paladins. 
- In North Geskoworm, the new young ruler Krorgfrey abstains from participating in the counterattack in favor of focusing on forming the city of New Geskoworm. 
- In Fywick, the oracle provides her final remaining intel to Wegate, the intel being that Narascus is still alive and reborn as the Red Archon, a being of unspeakable power and cruelty. After seeing this horrifying visage, the oracle dies. Fywick does not send any additional support.

### The Counterattack on Hastow

- Breezy-e arrives first, teleporting directly to Hastow to go and rekill Narascus. The new Narascus (aka The Red Archon) is able to not just fight off Breezy-e but gets to back down by threatening to use a wish to cause the Illithid Empire to return. Not understanding how wish works, Breezy-e backs down from fighting and killing him, and makes a peace deal. Hostilities with Gothriathon and Hastow cease. 

### Bayrhys's Northern Invasion
- They travel by small boat through the sea of ghosts. They pick up some undead to assist them. Fighting on the northern shores of the continent against Hastow, which forces them to divert resources away from fighting Wegate. It is more a distraction rather than an effective incursion due to the size of Bayrhys's forces.

### The Eternal Battlefield
- Wegate and Hastow land forces engage in battle to the south of wardson tower. Most of the remaining spelljammers are destroyed, halting the Wegate drive into Altricia. Fortifications built, undead maintain the battle lines, Wegate and Hastow are now locked in an eternal struggle. From this point forward no new advances in the battle lines are created as both sides just send endless waves of undead at one another, and resurrect them back up to fight again.

- Wegate learns that Gothriathon made their own peace and doesn't take the news well. Vesrahan sees this as a betrayal, citing written docs and alliances, however they were never signed by Os. Os sees no obligation to contribute support, but Breezy-e being a signer, must stand before Asmodeus for breach of contract. Breezye is in the wrong if he fights the Red Archon or if he doesn't. A new deal with Asmodeus is brokered where Breezy-e may never kill on Mardun again. Though he has the means, Breezy-e never leaves to other planets since quality spaghetti can only be grown on Mardun. 

- Wardson Tower, an enterance to a vicious section of the underdark, oversees the eternal battlefield of Hastow and Wegate. The tower's stonework never breaks/changes given its magical location on a minor leyline. From this, an order of fighters arise, founded by a living fighter who witnessed Spoops and Mortis Lux, developing a fighting style from it. 

- The constant death and resurrection of Hastow and Wegate forces creats a new kind of undead: Soultorn. This new monster is found only on the eternal battlefield. They can no longer distinguish friend or foe and simply kill whoever they can. Apparently they cannot die. Wardson Tower uses them for target practice. 

- From the backing out of Os from the alliance with Wegate, a new revulsion of necromancy in all its forms occurs in Gothriathon.

- With advanced automatons carrying out Bazzdos's will and Spoops continuing to provide Gond souls into the soul core, Bazzdos subsides his body inside this new vessel, becoming a Gargantuan Construct of Brass. While capable of leaving the construct, Bazzdos prefers to remain within it, as it provides a more powerful and durable body than his previous one.
- Bazzdos initiates a 100-year plan to create a new empire of construction and infrastructure in the Plane of Fire, using the City of Brass as his base of operations. He begins creating a new army of automatons and constructs, using the city's resources to fuel his ambitions.

He loses communication with the outside, and the remaining automatons in the Realm of Fire are left to wander.

- **[Kaltrosar Bay](/locations/kaltrosar-bay)**: Becomes an infernal slave state ruled by a tiefling aristocracy after a devil-worshipping king took power. [Fort Suro](/locations/Mardun/Fort-Suro) and surrounding areas were abandoned as people fled [Kaltrosar Bay](/locations/Mardun/Kaltrosar)'s growing influence. 
- Dragonborn exiles flee south towards Vrintia, and Tiamar's Bazzar.

- Arn continues to militarize, but cannot overcome the demonic influence of Kaltrosar, and soon full scale war breaks out. 
- Seeking to expand westward, Os offers to protect Arnsworth in return for their fealty. King Reuben of Arnsworth begrugingly agrees.

- Os Vrintia establishes evlish control of Arsworth by anointing his son ??? ??? Daera Vrintia to the throne as Duke.

## The Voyage of Breezy-E (365 AC / 165 VY)

- Despite his heroic deeds which saved the world, being a powerful force of protection, easily fighting against the strongest foes, and their long standing friendship, **Breezy-E** is mournfully banished from the lands of Vrintia by Os for being undead. The Royals and Nobility fear and revile his necrotic nature, and his newest contract with Asmodeus makes him far less useful as a protector or weapon. 
- Breezy-E leaves for the west seeking the best place to grow spaghetti on Mardun. He goes over the Saber river, and through Arn, and his departure from the lands of Vrintia is marked with the Lost Wind Gate. 
- He spends the next few decades travelling up and down the Wild Coast, planting spaghetti and becoming a folk legend as a wandering samurai.
- He travelled up through the Witchlight Jungles, and eventually wanders into Fywick. Missing his old days as an adventurer, and given how nobody recognized him anymore, and perhaps through the spirit of Meade, he finds himself as part of an adventuring team once more. 
- His adventure team is part of the Fywick colonization efforts of making Felldora more habitable for mortal life, by clearing out ancient ruins, and fighting off monsters on the Emerald Shores. 
- Getting around his ban on killing from Asmodeus, Breezy-E makes quick work of monsters and dungeons by leaving everyone at 1 hp so his party members can kill them. His party is completely at awe since they are unaware that they are in the presence of possibly the strongest fighter on Mardun and the chosen of Bhaal. 
- Unfortunately the dark powers of Felldora take notice to this unknown lowly adventurer almost killing everything with ease, and the vampire tribe of La Bocca della Fuoco (The Mouth of Fire) are set to kill this party.
- Breezy-E's party is deep in the Ironwood forests hunting down great beasts when suddenly they are attacked by Fuoco vampires. Breezy-E's efforts are not enough this time and the vampires kill his party. Unable to kill them, Breezy-E is left with no choice but to reveal himself. ---- Something about the spaghetti god here----
- Breezy-E eventually finds La Bocca della Fuoco and breaks inside, casting away all opponents until he finds Dante Flamma, the powerful head vampire of the tribe. ---he defeats him in some stupid way---
- He's so angry that he doesn't even care about his contract with Asmodeus anymore and prepares his ultimate spaghetti god attack to wipe out all the Fuoco vampires. But then he notices out of the corner of his eye a soil acidity chart, and average yearly temperature and rainfall graph and realizes that this small corner of Mardun is the optimal place for growing wheat and tomatos. This calms him down, saving the vampires and his own soul from Asmodeus.
- As the new head of the vampire tribe, Breezy-E renames La Bocca della Fuoco **[La Rocca della Sugo](/locations/la-rocca-della-sugo)** (The Rock of Sauce).

## Arn's Rebellion (553-555 AC / 353-355 VY)

- Emboldened by their defensive capabilities, the loss of Breezy-E, and the Slumber of Inferno, **Duke Othniel of Arnsworth** declares independence from Vrintia, and himself as the new king.
- Arnsworth takes control of Tiamar's Bazzar, securing the major magical weapons depot. It is uncertain even to this day if the dragonborn clans of Tiamar's Bazzar were complicit in this takeover, preferring rule of Arnsworth over the rule of Vrintia. However it can be clear that a scism between Tiamar dragonborn and Vrintia dragonborn remains to this day.
- Arnsworth also practices new fae magic learned from the fey forests that are near the capital castle, in an effort to counteract any of Vrintia's powerful mages.
- ---todo wargame this out to find any cool tactics----
- In the end, Arn's Rebellion is crushed, **Duke Othniel** is executed for treason, and a new elvish **Duke Feno Herfiel Lozzit Vrintia** is put in charge of Arnsworth. Arnsworth would remain under elvish occupation for 445 years until 798 VY when human **Duke Blackshield** would be symbolically given power.
