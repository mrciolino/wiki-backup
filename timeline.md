# History

## The Early Universe

### Creation of Worlds & Primordial Chaos
- Spoops awakens alone in **[The Well of Souls](/locations/The-Well-Of-Souls)**. The creation of Souls begins, and AO jams his door shut.
- The universe begins with chaotic primordial energy, birthing the **[Old Gods](/entities/old-gods)**.
- The Old Gods impose order, shaping planets, planes, and celestial structures.

### Rise of the New Gods
- A second generation of gods, more powerful and attuned to order, overthrows the Old Gods.
- Some Old Gods are contained or dispersed; others flee to the **[Far Realms](/locations/far-realms)**.

### Divine Rule & the Birth of Titans
- The New Gods take dominion and prevent another power shift.
- They create **[Titans](/entities/titans)**—lesser godlike beings—to maintain order.
- Spoops opens the floodgates of The Well, allowing souls to flow into creation.
- Mortal races emerge, alongside the primordial forces of **Good** and **Evil**.

### The War in Heaven
- The Titans rebel against the New Gods, foreseeing their obsolescence.
- The Titans are defeated; **Kronos**, the most powerful Titan, is sealed in the **[Chains of Karseri](/artifacts/chains-of-karseri)**.
- These chains anchor his prison to the celestial order, including Mardun.

### The Continuation of Creation
- Gods, Titans, and angels collaborate to populate worlds like **[Mardun](/locations/mardun)**.
- **Magic** emerges as a natural phenomenon, not a divine creation.
- New gods enter the divine system.

## The Age of Ascended (1 AC – ?)
### Sundering of Mortis Lux
- Without Spoops to guide Mortis Lux, the main lieutenants return to Mardun, with the exception of the Saragossa Pirates who stay in space.
	- Narascus becomes regent of Hastow.
  - Versrahan becomes regent of Wegate.
  - Luther becomes regent of Altricia.
  - Os and Breeze-e return to Gothriathon.
  - Kierkegaard returns to Bahryst.
  - Bazzdos and Gilthur return to North Geskoworm.
  - Meade returns to Fywick.
  - Adalynn remains in her flying fortress.
- Gilthur abdicates his titles as Pirate King of Saragossa and King of Altricia.
- The remaining Low Bar Brawlers attend the council of the gods, where [Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) attempts to sieze the weave from Mystra, causing Breezy-e to kill her. 
- Adalynn's fortress becomes inoperable for spelljammer transport (until Illiard takes control back in the future).
- Narascus, forseeing disarray, makes his initial claim to be the successor of Spoops. His claim gains some sympathy from Mortis Lux members, but his claim is challenged by others.
- Bazzdos sees the party fractures taking hold and accelerates his plan to collect more [Gond](/characters/Gond) souls by abducting more gnomes named Gond. This leads to direct conflict with Gilthur who must protect the Geskoworm Gnomes. 
- Bazzdos' warforged army attacks and easily takes North Geskoworm. Gilthur and Bazzdos duel, both deal significant damage to eachother. Bazzdos attempts a temporary retreat into the Forge Dimenstion, but his ring breaks after closing off the portal, trapping him inside. The remaining warforged lose their coordination and are finished off by the gnomes. Gilthur succumbs to his wounds and the blessing of garl Glittergold is passed to Krorgfrey. The speaking stone networks decay into dysfunction as the forge dimension gets sucked further into the Plane of Fire.
### 15 AC The Hastow-Wegate War
- In an effort to seize power as the new ruler of Mortis Lux, Narascus uses hundreds of spelljammers to launch a surprise attack Wegate and marches a land force on Altricia. Altricia falls easily, Luther is captured, and the remaining troops march on Wegate.
#### Battle of Wegate
- Narascus bombards Wegate, dropping undead on and outside the less defended city. Undead vs Undead and necrotic magical combat ensue. 
- However, this attack was forseen by the oracle of Fywick who shared this intel with allies of Mortis Lux, who all were prepared to defend Wegate. 2/3 of Hastow spelljammers are destroyed.
- Breezy-e teleports to Narascus' command ship, demanding an explanation for this attack. Narascus almost manages to convince breezy-e that this is the will of Spoops, but to seal the deal that there is nothing suspicious, Breezy-e offers to share a bowl of spaghetti which Narascus hates. This sours his ruse with Breezy-e, leading to a duel where Narascus is defeated. Breezy-e thinks he killed Narascus and commands the fleet to leave. 
- Hastow spelljammer forces are forced to retreat back to Hastow. Breezy-e returns to Os at Gothriathon. 
- The Hastow land force arrive in Wegate and find out Narascus has already been defeated. Most of the living necromancers are persuaded diplomatically to side with Wegate. The turncoats inform Wegate that [Altricia](/locations/Mardun/Allford) is captured and Luther was taken prisoner back in Hastow. The new Wegate army is sent to march back to [Altricia](/locations/Mardun/Allford)
#### Preparation for the Counterattack
- Narascus returns via spelljammer and finds Luther and other Altrician nobility imprisoned. Most of his forces are destroyed or turned to Wegate, and he himself is strongly injured. Narascus' body is rejuvinated via a demonic blood ritual where Luther and the other nobles are sacrificed. Narascus arises, empowered anew, and reinvigorated as the Red Archon.
- Wegate begins rebuilding some spelljammers without Bazzdos' assistance. New spelljammers used as aerial support. 
- Os in Gothriathon, having grown distant from Mortis Lux, takes a removed approach from the counterattack. Not willing to die over the remains of Mortis Lux, he only sends Breezy-E. 
- In Bayrhys, learning of the death of Luther in a blood sacrifice, Kierkegaard swears eternal vengance and has sent out forces of elite paladins. 
- In North Geskoworm, the new young ruler Krorgfrey abstains from participating in the counterattack in favor of focusing on forming the city of New Geskoworm. 
- In Fywick, the oracle provides her final remaining intel to Wegate, the intel being that Narascus is still alive and reborn as the Red Archon, a being of unspeakable power and cruelty. After seeing this horrifying visage, the oracle dies. Fywick does not send any additional support.
#### The Counterattack on Hastow
- Breezy-e arrives first, teleporting directly to Hastow to go and rekill Narascu. The new Narascus (aka The Red Archon) is able to not just fight off Breezy-e but gets to back down by threatening to use a wish to cause the Illithid Empire to return. Not understanding how wish works, Breezy-e backs down from fighting and killing him, and makes a peace deal. Hostilities with Gothriathon and Hastow cease. 

- **Bayrhys's northern invasion**. They travel by small boat through the sea of ghosts. They pick up some undead to assist them. Fighting on the northern shores of the continent against Hastow, which forces them to divert resources away from fighting Wegate. It is more a distraction rather than an effective incursion due to the size of Bayrhys's forces.

- Wegate and Hastow land forces engage in battle to the south of wardson tower. Most of the remaining spelljammers are destroyed, halting the Wegate drive into Altricia. Fortifications built, undead maintain the battle lines, Wegate and Hastow are now locked in an eternal struggle. From this point forward no new advances in the battle lines are created as both sides just send endless waves of undead at one another, and resurrect them back up to fight again.

- Wegate learns that Gothriathon made their own peace and doesn't take the news well. Vesrahan sees this as a betrayal, citing written docs and alliances, however they were never signed by Os. Os sees no obligation to contribute support, but Breezy-e being a signer, must stand before Asmodeus for breach of contract. Breezye is in the wrong if he fights the Red Archon or if he doesn't. A new deal with Asmodeus is brokered where Breezy-e may never kill on Mardun again. Though he has the means, Breezy-e never leaves to other planets since quality spaghetti can only be grown on Mardun. 

- Wardson Tower, an enterance to a vicious section of the underdark, oversees the eternal battlefield of Hastow and Wegate. The tower's stonework never breaks/changes given its magical location on a minor leyline. From this, an order of fighters arise, founded by a living fighter who witnessed Spoops and Mortis Lux, developing a fighting style from it. 

- The constant death and resurrection of Hastow and Wegate forces creats a new kind of undead: Soultorn. This new monster is found only on the eternal battlefield. They can no longer distinguish friend or foe and simply kill whoever they can. Apparently they cannot die. Wardson Tower uses them for target practice. 

- Being mortal, Vesrahon eventually dies and enters the afterlife. 
- From the backing out of Os from the alliance with Wegate, a new revulsion of necromancy in all its forms occurs in Gothriathon.
