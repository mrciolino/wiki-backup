# History

## The Early Universe

### Creation of Worlds & Primordial Chaos
- The universe begins with chaotic primordial energy, birthing the **[Old Gods](/entities/old-gods)**.
- The Old Gods impose order, shaping planets, planes, and celestial structures.

### Rise of the New Gods
- A second generation of gods, more powerful and attuned to order, overthrows the Old Gods.
- Some Old Gods are contained or dispersed; others flee to the **[Far Realms](/locations/far-realms)**.

### Divine Rule & the Birth of Titans
- The New Gods take dominion and prevent another power shift.
- They create **[Titans](/entities/titans)**—lesser godlike beings—to maintain order.
- Mortal races emerge, alongside the primordial forces of **Good** and **Evil**.

### The War in Heaven
- The Titans rebel against the New Gods, foreseeing their obsolescence.
- The Titans are defeated; **Kronos**, the most powerful Titan, is sealed in the **[Chains of Karseri](/artifacts/chains-of-karseri)**.
- These chains anchor his prison to the celestial order, including Mardun.

### The Continuation of Creation
- Gods, Titans, and angels collaborate to populate worlds like **[Mardun](/locations/mardun)**.
- **Magic** emerges as a natural phenomenon, not a divine creation.
- New gods enter the divine system.
