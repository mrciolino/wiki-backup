# The Early Universe

## Creation of Worlds & Primordial Chaos
- [Spoops](/characters/spoops) awakens alone in **[The Well of Souls](/locations/The-Well-Of-Souls)**. The creation of Souls begins, and AO jams his door shut.
- The universe begins with chaotic primordial energy, birthing the **[Old Gods](/entities/old-gods)**.
- The Old Gods impose order, shaping planets, planes, and celestial structures.

## Rise of the New Gods
- A second generation of gods, more powerful and attuned to order, overthrows the Old Gods.
- Some Old Gods are contained or dispersed; others flee to the **[Far Realms](/locations/far-realms)**.

## Divine Rule & the Birth of Titans
- The New Gods take dominion and prevent another power shift.
- They create **[Titans](/entities/titans)**—lesser godlike beings—to maintain order.
- Spoops opens the floodgates of [The Well](/locations/The-Well-Of-Souls), allowing souls to flow into creation.
- Mortal races emerge, alongside the primordial forces of **Good** and **Evil**.

## The War in Heaven
- The Titans rebel against the New Gods, foreseeing their obsolescence.
- The Titans are defeated; **Kronos**, the most powerful Titan, is sealed in the **[Chains of Karseri](/artifacts/chains-of-karseri)**.
- These chains anchor his prison to the celestial order, including [Mardun](/locations/Mardun).

## The Continuation of Creation
- Gods, Titans, and angels collaborate to populate worlds like **[Mardun](/locations/Mardun)**.
- **Magic** emerges as a natural phenomenon, not a divine creation.
- New gods enter the divine system, such as [Zeus](/characters/zeus) and [Bane](/characters/bane).

## Ancient Events

- **Deep Gnome Lore:** *TODO*
- **Fall of the Illithid Empire:** *TODO*
- Spoops spends time under the name Myrkul and adventures as one of the dead 3. The Time of Troubles occurs.
- Dragons migrate to the lands of Dracofell, which becomes a holy land to their kind. Only Dragons, dragonborn, and kobolds may enter it. 
- **2150 BC:** **[Inferno](/characters/inferno)**, who would go on to become the longest living dragon, is born in Dracofell to parents **Blazius** and **Ierris**. 
- **[Darmuth](/characters/darmuth)**'s body begins to form in response to the heightened levels of magic on Mardun.

## Rise and Fall of Tiyamanni (1000 BC - 500 BC)  
  - **[Os Vrintia](/characters/os-vrintia)** travels back in time and founds the **[Empire of Tiyamanni](/organizations/empire-of-tiyamanni)**.

### Darmuth's Reign (650 BC)
  - A fully formed [Darmuth](/characters/Darmuth) seals Inferno in **[The Lovers' Promise Mountain](/locations/lovers-promise-mountain)**.  
  - [Darmuth](/characters/Darmuth) Marries [Os Vrintia](/characters/os)'s son, Evhal, and ascends as Empress of Tiyamanni.
  - Gnomes are driven out from Tiyamanni; they and residents of the Celestial Vale go and found **[Fywick](/locations/fywick)**.

### Collapse of Tiyamanni
Led by Darmuth's cruelty and mismanagement, combined with natural forces, the capital of Tiyamanni is rendered to ruin.

## The Necrotic Wars 

- **90–66 BC:** **[Spoops](/characters/spoops)** washes ashore on [Mardun](/locations/Mardun), becomes Grandmaster of the [Knights of Sedonnya](/organizations/Knights-of-Sedonnya).

    - [Ralindu](/characters/ralindu) and the other Lich lords wage war on the living world. 
- **4 BC:** Spoops washes ashore near **[Witchlight Jungle](/locations/witchlight-jungle)** and makes his way to [Fort Suro](/locations/Mardun/Fort-Suro). Gilthur is exiled from [North Geskoworm](/locations/Mardun/north_geskoworm) for being unfunny, and wanders to [Fort Suro](/locations/Mardun/Fort-Suro). North Geskoworm changes its name to "Krorg's Hometown" to disassociate itself from Gilthur.

- Spoops says his goodbyes and leaves on his journey to fulfil his 1000 year atonement. 
- Spoops begins by meeting up with Kelemvor to confront Cyric together. After many years of planning and conflict they are able to eliminate Cyric and cement Kelemvor's place as sole God of Death. 


## Mortis Lux Returns Home (1 AC - 15 AC)
- After the war ends and the party departs on various quests, Mortis Lux goes into standby mode. The main Generals, and lieutenants return to Mardun, with the exception of the Saragossa Pirates who stay in space after taking possession of their promised Spelljammer ships. 
- Illiard is made regent of Mortis Lux HQ during the party's absence, and is granted immortality by Spoops. He oversees basic operations and keeps HQ secure with the help of a legion of undead granted to him by Spoops, and a small group of living members. He keeps Mortis Lux's resources and finances active in case the old treaties and armies need to be called upon again. Jergal also hangs out with him sometimes.
- Many resources were distributed among the member states of Mortis Lux to help in the rebuilding of the many cities destroyed during the war. The flying ships were used for various purposes during the rebuilding. Many of the pilots during the war were clerics of [Hastow](/locations/Mardun/Hastow) and [Wegate](/locations/Mardun/Wegate), and they continued to pilot their ships during the reconstruction era. Hastow happened to supply the majority of clerics during the war and so when Narascus would later make his villainous moves, Hastow's fleet was the largest.
	- [Narascus](/characters/Narascus) becomes Ruler of [Hastow](/locations/Mardun/Hastow).
  - [Vesrahaan](/characters/vesrahaan) returns to rule [Wegate](/locations/Mardun/Wegate).
  - Gilthur abdicates the throne of Altricia to Luther after his valiant efforts in protecting the city from Ithilid attack. Luther becomes King of [Altricia](/locations/Mardun/Allford).

  - [Kierkegaard](/characters/kierkegaard) and his wife return to rule [Bahyrst](/locations/Mardun/Bahyrst) with his wife.
  - [Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos) returns to the [Forge Dimension](/locations/Forge-Dimension) and begins creation of the first automaton prototypes—an iteration of the AI bots used for fabrication work in the Forge.
  - [Gilthur](/characters/krorg) return to [North Geskoworm](/locations/Mardun/north_geskoworm).
  - [Meade](/characters/meade) returns to [Fywick](/locations/Mardun/Fywick).
  - [Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) remains in her flying fortress for a time until her betrayal.
  
### Adalynn's Betrayal
- The remaining Low Bar Brawlers attend the council of the gods, where [Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) attempts to seize the weave from [Mystra](/characters/mystra) whos been subdued by [Mask](/characters/mask), causing [Breezy-e](/characters/breezy) to kill her. 
- [Mortis Lux HQ](/locations/mortis-lux-hq) becomes inoperable for spelljammer transport until [Illiard](/characters/illiard) takes control back after [Spoops](/characters/spoops) and [Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos) perform [Soul Surgery](/Spells/soul-surgery) to transfer control of the dimension to him.

### Narascus Makes his Move
- [Narascus](/characters/Narascus), forseeing disarray, makes his initial claim to be the prophet and now successor of [Spoops](/characters/spoops). His claim gains some sympathy from his own clerics, but his claim is challenged by others. Primarily the Wegatians.

### ~10 AC
- Bazzdos sees party fractures taking hold and begins planning to assume control of the gnomish people by emulating the god Gond. He begins creating infrastructure for a massive mining and forge operation in North Geskoworm. He recruits gnomes from all over Mardun to support this operation and establish mining for iron, mithril, and other metals.

### ~14 AC

- With the incredibly fast industrialization of North Geskoworm, it becomes a wealthy trade city and the leading exporter of mithril and mithril goods. The gnomes begin to see Bazzdos as a god of the forge akin to Gond, but just as they begin to worship him, Bazzdos starts seeing them as a means to an end. He begins using gnomes named Gond to collect Gond souls and incorporate them into his own soul core. This leaves many gnomes in a state of having to relearn their world, as a small part of their soul is missing.

### ~15 AC

- Gilthur learns of Bazzdos taking a small part of Gond from the gnomes and confronts him to protect the Gnomish Gonds.
- Bazzdos's first automatons, originally used to run the mining operations, easily take control of North Geskoworm in an occupation that lasts two months. In a final battle of the rebellion, Gilthur and Bazzdos duel, both dealing significant damage to each other. Seeing the people he wished to lead rise against him, Bazzdos retreats into the Forge Dimension.
- The remaining automatons lose coordination due to delays in the speaking stone networks, making them vulnerable to coordinated attacks and are destroyed by the gnomes.
- Gilthur, Hero of North Geskoworm, succumbs to his wounds, and the blessing of Garl Glittergold passes to Krorgfrey.
- As the party crumbles, Bazzdos begins shutting down the speaking stone network, as it is too exposed to the Naracenes.
- Bazzdos starts developing a new, more secure speaking stone network, unconnected to the old system, allowing better control over the automatons and AI robots.
- Bazzdos decides to leave Mardun for a time and travels to the Plane of Fire, where he begins new projects and future plans.

## The Hastow-Wegate War (15-16 AC)
- In an effort to seize power and crush any religious opposition, Narascus uses hundreds of spelljammers to launch a surprise attack on Wegate, and marched his armies over land on Altricia. Altricia falls easily, Luther is captured, and the remaining troops march on Wegate.

### Battle of Wegate
- Narascus bombards Wegate, dropping undead on and outside the less defended city. Undead vs Undead and necrotic magical combat ensue. 
- However, this attack was forseen by the oracle of Fywick who shared this intel with allies of Mortis Lux, who all were prepared to defend Wegate. 2/3 of Hastow spelljammers are destroyed.
- Breezy-e teleports to Narascus' command ship, demanding an explanation for this attack. Narascus almost manages to convince breezy-e that this is the will of Spoops, but to seal the deal that there is nothing suspicious, Breezy-e offers to share a bowl of spaghetti which Narascus hates. This sours his ruse with Breezy-e, leading to a duel where Narascus is defeated. Breezy-e thinks he killed Narascus and commands the fleet to leave. 
- Hastow spelljammer forces are forced to retreat back to Hastow. Breezy-e returns to Os at Gothriathon. 
- The Hastow land force arrive in Wegate and find out Narascus has already been defeated. Most of the living necromancers are persuaded diplomatically to side with Wegate. The turncoats inform Wegate that [Altricia](/locations/Mardun/Allford) is captured and Luther was taken prisoner back in Hastow. The new Wegate army is sent to march back to [Altricia](/locations/Mardun/Allford)

## Ereriad's Fall
- **[Ereriad](/locations/ereriad)'s Fall**: [Bane](/characters/bane) killed Ereriad's major players and took over the world following the [Emperor](/characters/illithid-emperor)'s defeat.
- Porthy and Highhold become the only "free" nations as Bane leaves them alone as to not incur the wrath of Mortis lux, however without the speaking stone network, and with HQ inaccessible, they are highly isolated.
- Many flee Porthy and Highhold to Mardun via Gate and Spelljammer ship, where they find the rest of the Mortis Lux Member States involved in various conflicts of their own. With major contlicts on both worlds, neither is in a position to assist the other, particularly with the speaking syone network down and Mortis Lix HQ inaccessible. 

### Preparation for the Counterattack
- Narascus returns via spelljammer and finds Luther and other Altrician nobility imprisoned. Most of his forces are destroyed or turned to Wegate, and he himself is gravely injured. Narascus' body is rejuvinated via a demonic blood ritual where Luther and the other nobles are sacrificed. Narascus arises, empowered anew, and reinvigorated as the Red Archon.
- Wegate begins rebuilding some spelljammers without Bazzdos' assistance. New spelljammers used as aerial support. 
- Os in Gothriathon, having grown distant from Mortis Lux, takes a removed approach from the counterattack. Not willing to die over the remains of Mortis Lux, he only sends Breezy-E. 
- In Bayrhys, learning of the death of Luther in a blood sacrifice, Kierkegaard swears eternal vengance and has sent out forces of elite paladins. 
- In North Geskoworm, the new young ruler Krorgfrey abstains from participating in the counterattack in favor of focusing on forming the city of New Geskoworm. 
- In Fywick, the oracle provides her final remaining intel to Wegate, the intel being that Narascus is still alive and reborn as the Red Archon, a being of unspeakable power and cruelty. After seeing this horrifying visage, the oracle dies. Fywick does not send any additional support.

### The Counterattack on Hastow

- Breezy-e arrives first, teleporting directly to Hastow to go and rekill Narascus. The new Narascus (aka The Red Archon) is able to not just fight off Breezy-e but gets to back down by threatening to use a wish to cause the Illithid Empire to return. Not understanding how wish works, Breezy-e backs down from fighting and killing him, and makes a peace deal. Hostilities with Gothriathon and Hastow cease. 

### Bahyrst's Northern Invasion
- A task force of paladins of [Bahryst](/locations/Mardun/Bahyrst) travel by small boat through the sea of ghosts. They pick up some undead to assist them. They begin attacking [Hastow's](/locations/Mardun/Hastow) forces on the northern shores of the continent, which forces them to divert resources away from fighting [Wegate](/locations/Mardun/Wegate). It is not enough ti turn the tide of war due to the size of Bahyrst' forces compared to the far larger armies of Hastow.

### The Eternal Battlefield
- [Wegate](/locations/Mardun/Wegate) and [Hastow](/locations/Mardun/Hastow) land forces engage in battle to the south of [Wardson Tower](/locations/Mardun/wardson-tower). Most of the remaining spelljammers are destroyed, halting the Wegatian offensive into [Altricia](/locations/Mardun/Allford). Fortifications built, undead maintain the battle lines, Wegate and Hastow are now locked in an eternal struggle. From this point forward no new significant advances in the battle lines are created as both sides send endless waves of undead at one another, and resurrect them back up to fight again.

- [Wegate](/locations/Mardun/Wegate) learns that [Gothriathon](/locations/Mardun/Gothriathon) made their own peace and doesn't take the news well. [Vesrahaan](/characters/vesrahaan) sees this as a betrayal, citing the treaties and alliances of [Mortis Lux](/organizations/mortis-lux), however they were never signed by [Gothriathon](/locations/Mardun/Gothriathon) who only had a trade deal with Mortis Lux. Os sees no obligation to contribute the support of Gothriathon, but Breezy-e, must stand before Asmodeus for breach of contract. Breezye is in the wrong if he fights the Red Archon or if he doesn't. A new deal with Asmodeus is brokered where Breezy-e may never kill on Mardun again. Though he has the means, Breezy-e never leaves to other planets since quality spaghetti can only be grown on Mardun. 

- Wardson Tower, an enterance to a vicious section of the underdark, oversees the eternal battlefield of Hastow and Wegate. The tower's stonework never breaks/changes given its magical location on a minor leyline. From this, an order of fighters arise, founded by a living fighter who witnessed Spoops and Mortis Lux, developing a fighting style from it. 

- The constant death and resurrection of Hastow and Wegate forces creats a new kind of undead: Soultorn. This new monster is found only on the eternal battlefield. They can no longer distinguish friend or foe and simply kill whoever they can. Apparently they cannot die. Wardson Tower uses them for target practice. 

- From the backing out of Os from the alliance with Wegate, a new revulsion of necromancy in all its forms occurs in Gothriathon. 

## Mecha-Tunarath vs. Iapetus
- After fultilling his commitments to Kelemvor, Spoops moves onto his next task. He must atone for the destruction of Dolarion by defeaing Tu'narath. Bazzdos committed to helping him with this task many years ago. 
- Spoops meets with Bazzdos in his Forge Dimension where they prepare for the contlict with the titan Iapetus.
- Spoops then works with Bazzdos to create an immense suit of power armor and weapons for Tu'narath. Then the two of them pilot Mecha-Tu'narath in combat against the titan Iaeptus. This results in the destruction of Iaeptus and Mecha-Tu'narath, their corpses and machinery creating a debris field that becomes a ring around Mardun.

## Spoops' Final Task: The Fragments of Gond's Soul
- Spoops moves onto his final and longest task, combining all lost fragments of Gond's soul. He scours the planes, finding every last fragment of Gond. Every so often, he sends large portions of Gond's soul to Bazzdos to add to his soul core.

## The Construction (215 AC / 15 VY)

- Bazzdos finds the City of Brass in the Plane of Fire and, with his army of automatons, begins occupying the city. Taking over the crucial lava rivers and foundries, he begins constructing a vessel for a Large Construct.
- With advanced automatons carrying out Bazzdos's will and Spoops continuing to provide Gond souls into the soul core, Bazzdos subsides his body inside this new vessel, becoming a Gargantuan Construct of Brass. While capable of leaving the construct, Bazzdos prefers to remain within it, as it provides a more powerful and durable body than his previous one.
- Bazzdos initiates a 100-year plan to create a new empire of construction and infrastructure in the Plane of Fire, using the City of Brass as his base of operations. He begins creating a new army of automatons and constructs, using the city's resources to fuel his ambitions.

- **250 AC / 50 VY** Refugees arrive from [Ereriad](/locations/Ereriad) fleeing from [Bane](/characters/bane). They settle around Vrintia and are welcomed in by Os.

## The Great Escape (333 AC / 133 VY)

- **333 AC / 133 VY** Upon hearing of a new power source that could fuel his foundries, [Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos) initiates a plan to transport his mobile foundry built of **The [City of Brass](/locations/city-of-brass)** back to Mardun over New Geskoworm. However there is a malfunction in his operation and the foundry crash lands into the **[Sea of Ice](/locations/sea-of-ice)** instead. Inadvertently, Bazzdos the Brass becomes trapped inside his creation under thousands of tons of burning brass, along with the majority of his automatons. He loses communication with the outside, and the remaining automatons in the Realm of Fire are left to wander. The impact also shatter's Bazzdows' consciousness into thousands of pieces, all of which slowly try to stich themselves back together.
- This renders a major ocean pathway near the Sea of Ice into a nearly unnavigable sea of icebergs and steam.

# The New Campaign Era
- **??? AC** Tiberian's family is killed
- **??? AC** Tomas' mother is forced to jump off Queen Daera Bridge by Walter Beste Wotera Vrintia

## The Present Day (1000 AC / 800 VY)

- **[Goopy](/characters/goopy)** arrives from space.
- The party is inducted into the [Royal Vrintian Academy](/organizations/rvasss)
- An urgent deadline sees the party leave to go free Oran's brother Verrick from the evil **Vaymir** in the Church of Crows. However the party is defeated and put in a slave pit, and **Goopy**, **Verrick**, and **Baloo** are killed.
- The party gets lost in the [Owlwoods]().

# Future Events

- **10XX AC / 8XX VY:** The **[Slaughter Bridge Battle](/events/slaughter-bridge-battle)** occurs, leading to the destruction of the Brass Brigade.
