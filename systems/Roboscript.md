# ü§ñ RoboScript  
The programming language created by [Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos). When the [Mechatarasque](/characters/mechatarasque) was discovered, his programming was decoded and re-written in RoboScript so Bazzdos could install modules for better control.

## üìù Description
When unconscious (dead or resting), this creature can be programmed with specific instructions and logic flow via its console on the back of its power armor. The script must be compiled and flashed to the creature's firmware with the press of the green button next to the console panel. An overflow of memory or an indefinite loop causes **Computer Overload**.  

## üìú Scripts
The first programs built on top of Bazzdos' source code are as follows. Syntax used orginally follow a Java link object oriented style but was later updated into a Pythonic style.

> ### **SCRIPT 1**
> ```python
> TALK like C3PO sometimes
> ```
> 
> ### **SCRIPT 2**
> ```python
> def overflow(count=10):
>     return overflow(count**count)
> 
> RUN overflow()
> ```
> 
> ### **SCRIPT 3** 
> ## **SCRIPT 3** {.tabset}
> 
> ### Updated
> ```python
> threat_level = getThreatLevel()
> if threat_level < 25:
>     stats = stats.default
> if threat_level >= 25:
>     stats = stats.default + 10
> ```
> 
> ### Original
> ```javascript
> if (bazzdows.threatLvl >= 50) {
>     bazzdows.stats.OC = 30;
> } else {
>     bazzdows.stats.OC = bazzdows.stats.default;
> }
> ```


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Computer Overload
When a RoboScript triggers memory or time overflows. This could occur if Bazzdos loses control of his mind or could even be triggered in an emergency situation to stop anyone from reaching Bazzdos' **soul core** and destroying his source code.
- Creature makes **1d6 random attacks**  
- Casts **1d4 random spells**  
- Then enters **Super Hibernation Form**: transforms into a compact, immobile metal box, still capable of observation.  
- Reboot requires specific actions.


## üß† Programmer Feedback
The only person to code in Roboscript besides Bazzdos was [Spoops](/characters/spoops). This was for the first Script 1, "`TALK like C3PO sometimes`", and for Script 3. For Script 1, a shock was given since C3PO was not in Bazzdos' memory. After some memory updates the **code passed quality checks** and Spoops was granted bless as according to the below logic:

- **Success:** A subtle electric charge grants **Bless** (*+1d4 to an ability roll*).  
- **Failure:** Sparks cause **1d6 Lightning damage** and stun for 6 seconds.  
- **Three Failures in a Row:** Tiny killer wasps emerge and attack the programmer.
