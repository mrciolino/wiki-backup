# RoboScript
The programming language created by Bazzdos. 

> **RoboScript**  
> When unconscious (dead or resting), this creature can be programmed with specific instructions and logic flow via its console on the back of its power armor. The script must be compiled and flashed to the creature's firmware with the press of the green button next to the console panel. An overflow of memory or an indefinite loop causes **Computer Overload**.  
>
> ```
> ----- Script 1 -----
> threat_level = getThreatLevel()
> if threat_level < 25:
>     stats = stats.default
> if threat_level >= 25:
>     stats = stats.default + 10
> ```

> **Computer Overload**  
> When a RoboScript causes memory or time overflows, this creature overloads. It randomly targets nearby creatures, making **1d6 random attacks** and casting **1d4 random spells**. Afterward, its defense mechanism activates, forcing it into **Super Hibernation Form**â€”a compact metal box. In this form, it cannot move or act but can observe its surroundings. It may be rebooted with the proper actions.

> **Programmer Feedback**  
> When a program is entered in an efficient or spectacular manner, the programmer is rewarded or punished by the creature.  
> - **Success:** The programmer receives a subtle electric charge, granting Bless, **+1d4 to an ability roll**.  
> - **Failure:** A poorly implemented script causes a spark, stunning the user for 6 seconds and dealing **1d6 Lightning damage**.  
> - **Three Failures in a Row:** Small killer wasps detach from hidden compartments in the armor and attack the programmer.
