# Time and Cost Calculation Guide 
This guide explains how to calculate the time and cost required to craft items using your artisan tools, based on item rarity, character stats, upgrades, and teamwork.


## Step-by-Step Crafting Time Calculation

1. **Start with Base Time**: From the rarity table above.
2. **Tool Proficiency**: If lacking, multiply time by **1.5**.
3. **Workshop Access**: If missing, multiply time by **1.25**.
4. **INT Modifier Reduction**: Subtract **5% per INT point above +1**.
5. **Proficiency Bonus Reduction**: Subtract **5% per PB point above +2**.
6. **Infrastructure Network Effects**: Apply bonuses from available structures in your specialized path.
7. **Gondian Path Upgrades**: Apply specific upgrade bonuses for your specialized items.
8. **Number of Artisans**: Divide time by **number of proficient helpers**.
9. **Round Up**: Always round the final time **up to the nearest full day**.
    
## **Example: Crafting a Rare Magic Item**

* **Item**: 🔥 **Flame Tongue Sword** 🔥 
* **Character**: Gondian Warforged Artificer, Level 9 - Forge Master Path
* **INT Modifier**: +4
* **Proficiency Bonus**: +4
* **Tool Proficiencies**: Smith's tools (✔️)
* **Infrastructure**: Advanced Shrine + 2 Basic Shrines in network
* **Gondian Upgrade**: Divine Anvil (craft holy weapons 3× faster)
* **Artisans Assisting**: 2 other proficient artisans
  
### **Calculation Steps**

1. **Base Time (Rare Item)**
   → From table: **8 weeks**

2. **Tool Proficiency**
   → ✔️ Has it: **No modifier**

3. **Workshop Access**
   → ✔️ Yes: **No modifier**

4. **INT Modifier (+4)**
   → +3 over +1 → **3 × 5% = -15%**

5. **Proficiency Bonus (+4)**
   → +2 over +2 → **2 × 5% = -10%**

6. **Forge Master Infrastructure Network**
   → **-15% time** (Sacred Structure network bonus)

7. **Gondian Upgrade: Divine Anvil**
   → **×0.33 time** (craft holy weapons three times faster)

8. **Multiple Artisans**
   → 3 total artisans → **÷3**

### 🧾 **Math Breakdown**

**Start: 8 weeks**
→ Apply -15% (INT) → `8 × 0.85 = 6.8` weeks
→ Apply -10% (PB) → `6.8 × 0.9 = 6.12` weeks
→ Apply -15% (Infrastructure) → `6.12 × 0.85 = 5.2` weeks
→ Apply ×0.33 (Divine Anvil) → `5.2 × 0.33 = 1.72` weeks
→ Apply ÷3 (artisans) → `1.72 ÷ 3 = 0.57` weeks

→ **Final Time: ⏳ 4 days** (0.57 weeks rounded up)

### 💰 **Cost**

* Base Cost (Rare) = **2,500 gp**
* Final Cost = **2,500 gp**
* Crafting Cost (50%) = **1,250 gp**

### ✅ **Summary**

The holy Flame Tongue Sword takes **4 days** to craft at a cost of **1,250 gp**, thanks to high INT, divine workshop access, Sacred Structure network bonuses, Divine Anvil upgrade specialization, and artisan teamwork.
