## The Disjuction of Godsbane
Season 4 | July 1st 2024

We activated an anti-magic field to contain the magic from the blade. This action actually released Bhaal from the blade, and we made a deal to kill Ceric. The remaining magic in the air was quickly seized by Spoops, Bazzdos, and Bhaal in an athletics contest, which involved multiple triple-digit athletic rolls.
