## The Disjuction of Godsbane
Season 4 | July 1st 2024

In an attempt to destory Ceric from the blade, Bazzdos decided to cast Mordenkainen's Disjunction on it. To prempt with choatic manuver, we activated an anti-magic field to contain the magic from the blade. The disjunction actually released Bhaal, not Ceric, from the blade, and we made a deal to kill Ceric with the help of Bhaal. The remaining magic in the air was quickly seized by Spoops, Bazzdos, and Bhaal in an athletics contest, which involved multiple triple-digit athletic rolls.
