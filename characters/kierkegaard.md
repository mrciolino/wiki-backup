# Kierkegaard
The first Paladin recruited by [Spoops](/characters/spoops). He is a selfless and faithful man who doesn't shy away from responsibility. 


## Ranks and Positions of Power
Throughout the story, Kierkegaard found himself at the helm of various factions, organizations, and even nations. 

After being [recruited by Spoops](/Events/the-ice-castle-of-bahyrst) to become his first paladin, Kierkegaard was granted the title First Lieutenant, and was in charge of the paladins while Spoops was away.

After the events of Campaign 1, he became Grandmaster of the Paladin [Order of the Soul-Wardens](/organizations/soul-wardens). As head of the paladin order, he inherited Spoops' castle and rule over [Bahyrst](/locations/Mardun/Bahyrst) where he would bring order and faith to the region, and train many more paladins.

At the formation of [Mortis Lux](/organizations/mortis-lux), Kierkegaard joined as representative of the Order of the Soul Warden. 

He was also made leader of the [Unified Forces of Spoops](/organizations/unified-forces-of-spoops) and Commander of the Mortis Lux Military.

Through his marriage to the [Princess of Hellaress](/characters/vilra-sunfenix), he became a prince of [Hellaress](/locations/Ereriad/Hellaress). However due to [Bane's](/characters/bane) posession of the [King](/characters/king-sunfenix) and domination of [Ereriad](/locations/Ereriad), Kierkegaard and his wife would not rule.



## Encounters

### Bahyrst
The party [first encountered Kierkegaard](/Events/the-ice-castle-of-bahyrst) in Bahyrst during their trip to find Spoops' castle granted to him by the [Deck of many things](/items/Deck_Of_Many_Things). 
When the party found out that there was an outbreak of lycanthropy in the city, and the townsfolk were being oppressed by the wizard [Fiad](/characters/fiad) who recently took over the castle, they rallied the townsfolk around the fountain in the middle of town, where Spoops made a proposal. Spoops displayed his Paladin power by purifying and blessing water from the fountain and using the new Holy Water to cure one of the lycanthropes. Then he called out to the crowd looking for new recruits to worship and train under him, it was Kierkegaard who was first to volunteer.

Kirkegaard was made Lieutenant of The new [Order of the Soul Warden](/organizations/soul-wardens), and began training alongside the other recurits.

After the party departed, he led the newly formed order in training, cleansing sickness and death, as well as running the affairs of the city now that Fiad was defeated and Spoops was away. 

### 3 Year Timeskip
During Spoops and [Vesrahaan's](/Events/wegate-revolution) [revolution in Wegate](/Events/wegate-revolution), Spoops contacted Kierkegaard, inviting the paladin order to join. However the paladin order was still needed in Bahyrst as they were in the middle of training, and setting up a functioning government. Not to mention the issue of traveling halfway accross the globe on short notice.

### Obox-Ob's Curse and Spoops' Blessing
During a [dinner party](/Events/meeting-obox-ob) in [Obox-ob's](/characters/obox-ob) domain in the Abyss. Obox-ob demanded a wedding be performed and insinuated that without one nobody would leave his domain without a fight. [Bane](/characters/bane) offered up the daughter of his host body, [King Sunfenix](/characters/king-sunfenix). Spoops called upon Kierkegaard and asked him if he would be willing to marry the princess. Kierkegaard agreed and they were promptly wed. 

However, Obox-ob cursed their union, making it so that one day their lineage would produce a demonic child. In response Spoops blessed their union, granting their bloodline immortality and youthfulness. They and their direct descendants would be granted immortality so long as they wished. If one of their descendants chose to die naturally this would be allowed. Spoops made Kierkegaard and the princess aware of the demonic curse and the influence Obox-ob could have over such a child, he ordered them to watch their bloodline closely to watch out for auch a child.

### The Unified Forces of Spoops
During the preparations for the [Ithillid War](/Events/ithilid-war), Kierkegaard was promoted to Leader of the Unified Forces of Spoops, which was comprised of the Soul Wardens, Army and Clerics of Wegate, and The Narascene Clerics of Hastow. He would hold this position until the events of the Narascene Schism. 

During the Ithillid War, he was made Military Commander of [Mortis Lux](/organizations/mortis-lux), he worked with the party and other leaders to coordinate the offensive on the Ithillid's beast and ships.

### After the Ithillid War

After the events of campaign 1, Kierkegaard returned with the rest of the Paladin order to rule over Bahyrst with his wife the princess of Hellaress.
