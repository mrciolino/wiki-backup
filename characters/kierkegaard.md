# Kierkegaard



## Encounters

### Bahyrst
The party first encountered Kierkegaard in Bahyrst during their trip to find Spoops' castle granted to him by the Deck of many things. 
When the party found out that there was an outbreak of lycanthropy in the coty, and the townsfolk were being oppressed by the wizard Fiad who recently took over rhe castle, they rallied the townsfolk around the fountain in the middle of town, where Spoops made a proposal. Spoops displayed his Paladin power by purifying and blessing water from the fountain and using the new Holy Water to cure one of the lycanthropes. Then he called out to the crowd looking for new recruits to worship and train under him, it was Kierkegaard who was first to volunteer.

Kirkegaard was made Lieutenant of The new Order of the Soul Warden, and began training alongside the otyer recurits.

After the party departed, he led the newly formed order in training, cleansing sickness and death, as well as running the affairs of the city now that Fiad was defeated and Spoops was away. 

### 2 Year Timeskip
During Spoops and Vesrahaan's revolution in Wegate, Spoops contacted Kierkegaard, inviting the paladin order to join. However the paladin order was still needed in Bahryst as they were in the middle of training, and setting up a functioning government. Not to mention the issue of travelling halfway accross the globe on short notice.
