### First Encounter
The party first met Guardison Sr. at the fishing village north of Fort Suro. He lives at the Lighthouse which is protected by powerful winds and is only accessible using the Wind Amulet.

Spoops saw how he was able to defy the wind to access his lighthouse, so Spoops stole the Wind Amulet from him.
