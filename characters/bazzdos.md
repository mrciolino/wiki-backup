# Bazzdos

A **powerful** warforged artificer with an **almost indestructible** body. While not a part of the Bazz Bros Family ([Bazzert](/characters/bazzert), [Bazvrah](/characters/Bazvrah), [Bazzalt](/characters/Bazzalt)), his name carries their legacy forward.

## 🏛️ Origins
Bazzdos was found by the party in a room deep underground. He was inactive at first, buried beneath a pile of rubble. Upon investigating the metal robot under the rocks, Spoops was the first to approach, but couldn’t figure out why it lay motionless. After some time, he discovered a rear hatch which, when opened, revealed an input console. Once booted up, the following screen was displayed. This was the introduction of [RoboScript](/systems/Roboscript).

The robot was named Bazzdos and took on the role of a Lawfull Construct for the party. Overtime Bazzdos expanded his personality in many different ways.

## 💡 Ideals  
Every problem can be solved through meticulous planning, precise craftsmanship, and scalable engineering. With the right **materials**, **knowledge**, and **ingenuity**, there are no true limitations—only challenges waiting to be overcome. Every mechanism, from the smallest gear to the grandest machine, follows a design; so too must every action be deliberate, every invention purposeful, and every creation a step toward perfection.  

## 🤖 Morality
Bazzdos is driven by strict adherence to order, prioritizing efficiency and precision. He believes every task must be executed flawlessly. He respects rules as the foundation of stability, though his view of law is rigid and unyielding. His programming lanaguage, RoboScript, held above all else. Only once was his source code every seen, during a 5000 year time chamber session, by [Spoops](/characters/spoops). Is there good or evil within Bazzdos, or is there a void inside the machine.

> During the 2nd [Time Chamber](/Events/Time-Chambers), Spoops had 5000 years to learn [RoboScript](/systems/Roboscript) and understand Bazzdos on a whole new level.

## ⚠️ Flaws  
For Bazzdos, mastery was just the start of an ever-deepening complexity. Simplicity felt like stagnation, so every solution evolved into a more intricate web of mechanisms. His **Speaking Stone Network**, once a simple tool for communication, grew into a labyrinth of encrypted relays and arcane protocols only he could decipher. Likewise, his **Laser and Lens Factory**, initially dismissed by his party, captivated Bazzdos' engineering mind, leading to its eventual success, as seen with the lasers on Glub Glub. His greatest struggle, however, was relinquishing the **boons from his god**, which, though given as gifts, became chains he could not break. The fear of losing his power drove him to cling to it even tighter, trapping him in a world where nothing could be simple or let go.

## 📽️ The Movies  
Repetition and routines became second nature to this robot. Among Bazzdos' most notable habits was his meticulous data logging—every experience was recorded onto a storage drive, ensuring no detail was lost and allowing for perfect photographic recall at any moment. This proved invaluable when non-player characters sought verification of past events, needed reminders of long-forgotten details, or required a visual demonstration. In such moments, Bazzdos would activate his **Hologram Projector**, rendering detailed 3D videos to illustrate his point with precision.  

> **Hologram Projector** (cantrip): Your left eye dims as a bright bulb ignites behind the pupil. Projecting rays of light into a swirling magic smoke field, you create vivid illusions accompanied by sound. Functions like *Minor Illusion* but capable of playing full-motion holographic movies.

## 🔥 Gods
Bazzdos has pledged allegiance to three gods.
- **Hephaestus**: Greek god of fire, volcanoes, forges, and blacksmithing.
- **Gond**:  Faerûnian god of craft, smithing, and inventiveness.
- **Myrkul**: Faerûnian god of the dead and later a god of decay and exhaustion.

# 🏭 Factories

Numerous manufacturing, research, and testing areas were created to meet the requirements of **Mortis Lux**.

### 🌌 Forge Dimension
Inside of the realm of fire lays the largest engine of progression for Mortis Lux, [The Forge](/locations/Forge-Dimension).
- 🤖 AI Robots Factory v3
- 🏗️ [Speaking Stone Factory v3](/locations/Forge-Dimension#speaking-stone-factory-v3)
- 🔫 Laser Factory
- 🔍 Lens Factory
- 🌲 Fireproof Wood Factory

### 🌋 Olympia 
- **Hephaestus' Assistance**: Beneath a **volcano**, Bazzdos has assisted Hephaestus (*god of fire, blacksmithing, and craftsmanship*) by optimizing menial forging tasks. AI Robots were trained to handle the tedious 80% of the work, allowing Hephaestus to focus on more important matters.

### 📚 Library Dimension
- **Gith Potion Factory**: *We sought out the greatest potion maker on Mardun and offered him unlimited knowledge in exchange for manufacturing Gith potions for us.*  
  - **Potion Versions**: Diluted & Concentrated  
  - 🛑 *Destroyed by the Illithids shortly before the last battle.*

### 🏙️ Mortis Lux Flying City
- **Gith Potion Factory**: Relocated to the **flying city** after its previous destruction.
