# Bazzdos

A **powerful** warforged artificer with an **almost indestructible** body. While not a part of the Bazz Bros Family ([Bazzert](/characters/bazzert), [Bazvrah](/characters/Bazvrah), [Bazzalt](/characters/Bazzalt)), his name carries their legacy forward.

## 🏛️ Origins
Bazzdos was found by the party in a room deep underground. He was inactive at first, buried beneath a pile of rubble. Upon investigating the metal robot under the rocks, Spoops was the first to approach, but couldn’t figure out why it lay motionless. After some time, he discovered a rear hatch which, when opened, revealed an input console. Once booted up, the following screen was displayed. This was the introduction of [RoboScript](/systems/Roboscript).

The robot was named Bazzdos and took on the role of a Lawfull Construct for the party. Overtime Bazzdos expanded his personality in many different ways.

## 💡 Ideals  
Every problem can be solved through meticulous planning, precise craftsmanship, and scalable engineering. With the right **materials**, **knowledge**, and **ingenuity**, there are no true limitations—only challenges waiting to be overcome. Every mechanism, from the smallest gear to the grandest machine, follows a design; so too must every action be deliberate, every invention purposeful, and every creation a step toward perfection.  

## 🤖 Morality
Bazzdos is driven by strict adherence to order, prioritizing efficiency and precision. He believes every task must be executed flawlessly. He respects rules as the foundation of stability, though his view of law is rigid and unyielding. His programming lanaguage, RoboScript, held above all else. Only once was his source code every seen, during a 5000 year time chamber session, by [Spoops](/characters/spoops). Is there good or evil within Bazzdos, or is there a void inside the machine.

> During the 2nd [Time Chamber](/Events/Time-Chambers), Spoops had 5000 years to learn [RoboScript](/systems/Roboscript) and understand Bazzdos on a whole new level.

## ⚠️ Flaws  
For Bazzdos, mastery was just the start of an ever-deepening complexity. Simplicity felt like stagnation, so every solution evolved into a more intricate web of mechanisms. His **Speaking Stone Network**, once a simple tool for communication, grew into a labyrinth of encrypted relays and arcane protocols only he could decipher. Likewise, his **Laser and Lens Factory**, initially dismissed by his party, captivated Bazzdos' engineering mind, leading to its eventual success, as seen with the lasers on Glub Glub. His greatest struggle, however, was relinquishing the **boons from his god**, which, though given as gifts, became chains he could not break. The fear of losing his power drove him to cling to it even tighter, trapping him in a world where nothing could be simple or let go.

## 📽️ The Movies  
Repetition and routines became second nature to this robot. Among Bazzdos' most notable habits was his meticulous data logging—every experience was recorded onto a storage drive, ensuring no detail was lost and allowing for perfect photographic recall at any moment. This proved invaluable when non-player characters sought verification of past events, needed reminders of long-forgotten details, or required a visual demonstration. In such moments, Bazzdos would activate his **Hologram Projector**, rendering detailed 3D videos to illustrate his point with precision.  

> **Hologram Projector** (cantrip): Your left eye dims as a bright bulb ignites behind the pupil. Projecting rays of light into a swirling magic smoke field, you create vivid illusions accompanied by sound. Functions like *Minor Illusion* but capable of playing full-motion holographic movies.

## 🔥 Gods
Bazzdos has pledged allegiance to three gods.
- **Hephaestus**: Greek god of fire, volcanoes, forges, and blacksmithing.
- **Gond**:  Faerûnian god of craft, smithing, and inventiveness.
- **Myrkul**: Faerûnian god of the dead and later a god of decay and exhaustion.

# 🏭 Factories

Numerous manufacturing, research, and testing areas were created to meet the requirements of **Mortis Lux**.

### 🌌 Forge Dimension
Inside of the realm of fire lays the largest engine of progression for Mortis Lux, [The Forge](/locations/Forge-Dimension).
- 🤖 AI Robots Factory v3
- 🏗️ [Speaking Stone Factory v3](/locations/Forge-Dimension#speaking-stone-factory-v3)
- 🔫 Laser Factory
- 🔍 Lens Factory

### 🌋 Olympia 
- **Hephaestus' Assistance**: Beneath a **volcano**, Bazzdos has assisted Hephaestus (*god of fire, blacksmithing, and craftsmanship*) by optimizing menial forging tasks. AI Robots were trained to handle the tedious 80% of the work, allowing Hephaestus to focus on more important matters.

### 📚 Library Dimension
- **Gith Potion Factory**: *We sought out the greatest potion maker on Mardun and offered him unlimited knowledge in exchange for manufacturing Gith potions for us.*  
  - **Potion Versions**: Diluted & Concentrated  
  - 🛑 *Destroyed by the Illithids shortly before the last battle.*

### 🏙️ Mortis Lux Flying City
- **Gith Potion Factory**: Relocated to the **flying city** after its previous destruction.

# 🔧 Bazzdos Timeline
From post-war industrialist to god-like construct, Bazzdos's journey spans centuries—rising as the gnomish forge master of North Geskoworm, conquering the City of Brass in the Plane of Fire, and ultimately crashing his brass empire into the Sea of Ice where he remains trapped, recently beginning to send distress signals to would-be rescuers.
    
## The Age of Ascended (1 AC – 553 AC) -> Early Post-War Period (1-15 AC)

- **1-15 AC**: After the war ends and the party departs on various quests, Mortis Lux goes into standby mode. Bazzdos returns to the Forge Dimension and begins creation of the first automaton prototypes—an iteration of the AI bots used for fabrication work in the Forge.

### Industrial Revolution of North Geskoworm (~10-15 AC)

- **~10 AC**: Bazzdos sees party fractures taking hold and begins planning to assume control of the gnomish people by emulating the god Gond. He begins creating infrastructure for a massive mining and forge operation in North Geskoworm. He recruits gnomes from all over Mardun to support this operation and establish mining for iron, mithril, and other metals.

- **~14 AC**: With the incredibly fast industrialization of North Geskoworm, it becomes a wealthy trade city and the leading exporter of mithril and mithril goods. The gnomes begin to see Bazzdos as a god of the forge akin to Gond, but just as they begin to worship him, Bazzdos starts seeing them as a means to an end. He begins using gnomes named Gond to collect Gond souls and incorporate them into his own soul core. This leaves many gnomes in a state of having to relearn their world, as a small part of their soul is missing.

### The Gnomish Rebellion (~15 AC)

- **~15 AC**: Gilthur learns of Bazzdos taking a small part of Gond from the gnomes and confronts him to protect the Gnomish Gonds.
- Bazzdos's first automatons, originally used to run the mining operations, easily take control of North Geskoworm in an occupation that lasts two months. In a final battle of the rebellion, Gilthur and Bazzdos duel, both dealing significant damage to each other. Seeing the people he wished to lead rise against him, Bazzdos retreats into the Forge Dimension.
- The remaining automatons lose coordination due to delays in the speaking stone networks, making them vulnerable to coordinated attacks and are destroyed by the gnomes.
- As the party crumbles, Bazzdos begins shutting down the speaking stone network, as it is too exposed to the Naracenes.
- Bazzdos starts developing a new, more secure speaking stone network, unconnected to the old system, allowing better control over the automatons and AI robots.
- Bazzdos decides to leave Mardun for a time and travels to the Plane of Fire, where he begins new projects and future plans.

## The Construction (215 AC / 15 VY)

- **215 AC / 15 VY**: Bazzdos finds the City of Brass in the Plane of Fire and, with his army of automatons, begins occupying the city. Taking over the crucial lava rivers and foundries, he begins constructing a vessel for a Large Construct.
- With advanced automatons carrying out Bazzdos's will and Spoops continuing to provide Gond souls into the soul core, Bazzdos subsides his body inside this new vessel, becoming a Gargantuan Construct of Brass. While capable of leaving the construct, Bazzdos prefers to remain within it, as it provides a more powerful and durable body than his previous one.
- Bazzdos initiates a 100-year plan to create a new empire of construction and infrastructure in the Plane of Fire, using the City of Brass as his base of operations. He begins creating a new army of automatons and constructs, using the city's resources to fuel his ambitions.

## The Great Escape (333 AC / 133 VY)

- **333 AC / 133 VY**: [Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos) escapes the Plane of Fire and crashes **The [City of Brass](/locations/city-of-brass)** into the **[Sea of Ice](/locations/sea-of-ice)**. This renders a major ocean pathway into a nigh innavigable sea of icebergs and steam. Bazzdos himself becomes trapped under thousands of tons of burning brass.

- Upon hearing of a new power source that could fuel his foundries, [Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos) drops the **The [City of Brass](/locations/city-of-brass)** into the **[Sea of Ice](/locations/sea-of-ice)** on Mardun. Inadvertently, Bazzdos the Brass becomes trapped inside his creation under thousands of tons of burning brass, along with the majority of his automatons. He loses communication with the outside, and the remaining automatons in the Realm of Fire are left to wander.
- This renders a major ocean pathway near the Sea of Ice into a nearly unnavigable sea of icebergs and steam.

### The New Campaign Era

- **??? AC**: Bazzdows begins to regain some function, and sends out a distress signal beckoning adventurers to the [Sea of Ice]().
