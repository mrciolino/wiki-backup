### Bazzert

## The End of the Beginning
During [Season 1](/Seasons) of the **first campaign**, Bazzert drew cards from the feared `Deck of Many Things`. This resulted in 3 cards: one good, one important, and one evil. The first card had a picture of the Throne, giving Bazzert an ancient keep in the Jade Forest (later used by [Bazvrah](/characters/Bazvrah) for [The Red Keep](/locations/Mardun/Red-Keep)). The second card had a picture of the Vizier, giving Bazzert 3 questions that must be answered about anything in the world. Questions raced through the party members' minds, but then came the third card: a picture of "The Void", leaving Bazzert paralyzed on the ground in front of the party. He remained that way for two and a half years until the party regrouped to go after [Darmuth](/characters/Darmuth) in [Season 2](/Seasons). This was the state in which important items remained on Bazzert during his long-term coma.

# Remaining Artifacts - Character Sheet (2020)
Listed below are the items, traits, and notable features remaining on the archived character sheet.

### The Immovable Rod
Many jokes and many opportunities arose with this single button press gimmick. From ripping a tear into the hull of a pirate ship (stopping force 9000 lbs), to stopping doors from being opened, to using this item to climb into the air. *(Seen as the inspiration for [Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos), an Iron Man-like Inventor)*

### The Sleep Crown
Once an unknown tool to the party, this item became a favorite for Bazzert as a way to take control of otherwise chaotic situations. When placed on the head of any creature, the creature would instantly fall asleep, allowing one to kidnap or kill quietly. Soon enough, other members of the party saw the usefulness of the crown and began using it for their own ends. *(Seen as the inspiration for [Bazvrah](/characters/bazvrah), a maniacal assassin)*

### The Druid Book
> How to Kill Gods:
> --------------------------------
> *Formulate a plan*  
> *It is disrespectful to kill an immortal deity without a well-thought-out plan of action*  
> *Stay up late. One often gets the best or worst ideas when one is on the brink of sleep deprivation and insanity*  
> *Seek help from others (no, not the therapeutic kind)*  
> *There are several people that want to kill gods; you are not alone*  

## Remaining Notes
When planning the assassination of the Pirate King of Sargossa:

> Cast darkness on the Pirate King and convince him  
> Naracus is a god or something using darkness  
> and wild shape  
> Do this once or twice to instill the fear of God in him  
>
> Cast darkness on the cat  
> and become a big golden lobster  
> and convince her  
>
> .5: Visit the PK to get a lay of the land before attacking - bring a squirrel and have a conversation with the PK  
> 1: Try to get a crew - first a normal request - ask them to help defend me - make sure to look for someone who doesn't like the PK - start up some chat  
> 2: Tell crew (2-3) to come with me outside of the PK room to await orders - they will be attacking other guards if needed  
> 2.5: Tell the pirate to move the immovable rod to the other side of the door while I distract people with a summoned animal (badger)  
> 3: Go visit the PK in the room and give him a crown out of good faith - come in excited and give him the high honor of wearing it  
> 4: Kill the PK while he is sleeping and kill the other guards in the room with conjure fey  
> 5: Take an item of the PK's, something small that fits in a bag, and leave the castle with the crew, going somewhere remote  
> 6: Kill the crew
