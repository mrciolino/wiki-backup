## The End of the Begining
During [Season 1](/Seasons) of the **first campaign**, Bazzert drew cards from the feared `Deck of Many Things`. This resulted in 3 cards, one good and one important and one evil. The fist card had a picture of Throne, giving Bazzert an ancient keep in jade forest (later used by Bazvrah for The Red Keep). The second card had picture of a Vizier, giving Bazzert 3 questions that must be answered about anything in the world. Questions raced through the party members' mind but then, the third card. A picture of a The Void, leaving Bazzert paraylzed on the ground in front of the party. He reamined that way for two and a half years until the party grouped back up to go after Darmuth in [Season 2](/Seasons). This was what important items remained on Bazzert during his long term coma.

# Remaining Artifacts - Character Sheet (2020)
Listed below are the items, traits, and notable features remaining on the archieved character sheet.

### The Immovable Rod
Many jokes and many opprunties came up with this single button press gimmick. From ripping a tear into the hull of a priate ship (stopping force 9000 lbs), to stopping doors from being opened, to using this item to climb into the air. *(Seen as the inspiration for Bazzdos, an Iron Man like Inventor)*

### The Sleep Crown
Once an unknown tool the the party, this item became a favorite for Bazzert as a way to take control of otherwise choatic situations. When placed on the head of any creature, the creature would insantly fall alseep allowing one to kidnap or kill quietly. Soon enough other members of the party saw the usefullness of the crown and would use it for their own ends. *(Seen as the inspiration for Bazvrah, a maniacal assassin)*

### The Druid Book
> How to kill Gods:
> --------------------------------
> *Formulate a plan
> *It is disrespectful to kill an immortal deity without a well thought out plan of action
> *Stay up late. One often gets the best or worst ideas when one is on the brink of sleep deprivation and insanity
> *Seek help from others (no not the therapeutic kind)
> *There are several people that want to kill gods, you are not alone
