## Lore

Son of Thetis and Peleus, blessed by the gods as a true warrior and athlete. Achilles at a young age excelled in sports especially rowing. He was taught by Socrates who later inspired him to compete in the Olympics. He won gold in the single scull twice. But became drunk and blinded with fame. He was smithed by Zeus, damaging his back preventing from rowing ever again. Found drunk in the local Inn he was recruited to wiled a sword to regain his honor. He joined the legion and became one of the greatest warriors to fight on the battlefield of Troy. 

Now he free lances and does small mercenary jobs as he hunts done the Zeus who had damaged me.
