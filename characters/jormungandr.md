# Jormungandr
The World Serpent. Former Servant of [Glub Glub](/characters/glub-glub).


## Glub Glub's Attack
Long ago, he was sent by Glub Glub to invade an ancient elven city on [Ereriad](/locations/Ereriad). At the xost of his life, [Spoops](/characters/spoops) was able to stop him as he entered the world by using ancient spells and [The Cleanser](/items/The-Cleanser) to seal him in the throne room of the ancient city. However, as he was sealed, Jormungandr managed to submerge the ancient city beneath the sea.

## Stealing His Soul
While [exploring the ancient sunken elven city](/Events/exploring-the-ancient-sunken-elven-city), [Spoops](/characters/spoops) broke Jormungandr's seal and used [Soul Steal](/spells/soul-steal) to trap his soul within a [Diamond](/items/Jormungandr-Diamond). 


## Subjugating Jormungander
During the [first time chamber](/Events/the-first-time-chamber), Spoops subjugated Jormungandr by breaming hos will over many years. In the end, Spoops convinced Jormungandr to grant him power in exchange for his freedom. Jormingandr accepted this deal and blessed Spoops with new abilities. True to his word, Spoops [summoned a sea snake](/items/ring-of-snakes) and placed Jormungandr's soul within it, allowing him to slither away into the sea.
