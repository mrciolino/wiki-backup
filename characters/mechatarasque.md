# Mechatarasque
A titanic construct of steel, flame, and radiant energy, the Mechatarasque is one of the few known sentient machines, rivaling gods and monsters alike in its destructive potential.

## Meeting Mechatarasque  
In the caves near [Highhold](/locations/Ereriad/Highhold), the Bazzdos encountered two warring monstrositiesâ€”a Bone Monstrosity and a Mechatarasque. In a battle reminiscent of *Godzilla vs. Kong*, seismic blows rained down, collapsing stalactites and shaking the cavern floor. After a brutal exchange, the Mechatarasque subdued its foe, leaving the Bone Monstrosity unconscious. As the dust settled, the metal titan turned to see four stunned adventurers observing its victory.



## Joining the Party  
Fascinated by this rare metallic constructâ€”one of only a handful known to exist (including himself and the Golden Knight)â€”Bazzdos saw an opportunity. He scoured the Mechatarasque's surface in search of a control interface, eventually with an *Arcana Crit of amost 50*, Bazz established a ðŸ”Œ into the creature,  establishing a connection. Over the next few days, Bazzdos decoded the ancient programming and uploaded new protocols using Roboscript/Bazzscript, taming the colossal machine into a devastating ally.


## Notable Fights  

 - **Shot from the Sky During the Illithid Invasion of Krorgâ€™s Hometown**
	- The moment comes, the big bad army is attacking your home world! Quick, get your best defenses which you spent years upgrading for this big fight. ðŸ’¥ BOOM ðŸ’¥, seeminly out of a portal in the sky, the ithilids ship fire 20 lasers at this Mechatarasque, taking it out in round 1 of combat. Bazzdos immediately rushes back to the [Mortis Lux Flying City] with the Mechatarasque to begins repairs before the launch to the Emperor Fight. 
- **Laser Ping Pong with Zeus and the Emperor**  
  > **Reflective Carapace**  
  > When targeted by magic missile, line spells, or ranged spell attacks, roll a d6. On 1â€“5, the Mechatarasque is unaffected; on a 6, the effect reflects back at the caster as if cast by the Mechatarasque.
