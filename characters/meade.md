# Origin
Meade grew up in the southern continent, where he honed his wit and intellect. His life changed forever when he encountered an evil Efreeti enslaving his friends. Using his cunning, he challenged the genie to a battle of wits and emerged victorious, earning a magical flask imbued with some of the Efreeti's power. This event set him on a path of adventure, leading him to join forces with the then exiled and wanted Os Vrtnica. Together they worked for peace and justice in the southern continent. His journey took him through many trials, including battles against dark forces. Ultimately, his adventures brought him to Fywick, where he established a new life as a bartender.
