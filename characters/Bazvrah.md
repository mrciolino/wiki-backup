# Bazvrah

Bazvrah is a deadly assassin, a fusion of Druid, Rogue, and Cleric, driven by a singular goalâ€”revenge. His target is Darmuth, whom he believes responsible for putting his brother, Bazzert, into a three-year coma. However, the truth is more complex; Bazzert fell into his slumber after drawing from the Deck of Many Things. With his newfound castle, granted by the same deck, Bazvrah established The Red Keep, a ruthless assassin's training ground.

> "My brother was always a powerful spellcaster. I have spent my time mastering the art of assassination and infiltration. My father constantly meditated with my brother in our family shrine. One day, a local drunk burned the shrine, destroying our sanctuary. That drunk was my first kill. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to perfect this newfound craft.
>
> When my brother disappeared two years ago, I received a castle in the Jade Forest. I have since transformed it into a training ground for assassins, forging a collective force known as The Red Castle. We train the mind and body, preparing for the art of the kill.
>
> I vow to kill whoever made my brother disappear."

## Training & Methodology
Upon hearing of his brother's coma, Bazvrah dedicated himself to the Circle of the Moon Druid path, perfecting Wild Shape for covert operations. His transformations allowed him to scout targets unnoticed, exploiting their weaknesses with precision. His killing ritual was simple yet effectiveâ€”utilizing his brotherâ€™s enchanted artifact, The Sleep Crown, he would force his targets into slumber before silently dispatching them with a dagger to the skull.

His career as a hired killer honed his instincts, enabling him to react swiftly to any interference with his objectives. Whether through brute force or careful subterfuge, he always found a method to complete the job, growing ever more confident in his craft.


## Journey to Revenge
At the height of The Red Keepâ€™s power, Mortis Lux sought Bazvrahâ€™s expertise for an assassination mission against Darmuth. He joined the party, traveling by boat to Wegate, with a stop in the Jade Forest to gather his resources. Along the way, he executed those who stood in his way, operating outside Mortis Luxâ€™s reputation to ensure his personal vendetta remained unhindered.

This ruthless pursuit led to a confirmed hit list during his time with the party:

> ### The Hit List
> 
> #### **Taken Off**
> 1. Meade â€“ For reminding me of an abusive drunk I once killed.
> 2. Former Teammates â€“ For abandoning me to the Frost Giants.
> 
> #### **Active Targets**
> 1. Thief who exposed my position in Osâ€™s city (400g bounty).
> 2. Incompetent Guard in Fywick.
> 
> #### **Confirmed Kills**
> 1. Italian dock worker in Fywick.
> 2. Steve-O â€“ For being insufferable in Fywick.
> 3. Steve Harvey â€“ For attempting to con me in Free-Real-Estate Town.
> 4. Kaltrsar Bay dock worker â€“ For arguing about money.


## Legacy of Death
Bazvrah's psychic powers, evident since childhood, allowed him to rack up over ten confirmed kills, including his very first as a young boy. With each successful assassination, he took a trophyâ€”something tangible to remind him of his skills, his past, and his lost innocence.

> ### The Necklace of History
> Around his neck, Bazvrah carries a leather cord adorned with relics from his kills, each a symbol of his deadly path:
> 1. **Tooth of Ivory**
> 2. **Small Iron Flower**
> 3. **Tiger Claw**
> 4. **Diamond Engagement Ring**
> 5. **Safe Key**
> 6. **Jade Statue**
> 7. **Iron Token** â€“ Taken from the Italian Dock Master.
> 8. **Steve-O's Glasses**
> 9. **Steve Harvey's Leather Belt Fragment**
> 10. **Sylivianâ€™s Beard Hair** â€“ A dock workerâ€™s keepsake.

This necklace serves as a grim testament to his journey, a weight of past sins and future vengeance resting upon his shoulders.

## Notable Traits and Items
Signatuer to Bazvrah's killing methods was a combination of traits and items which allowed him to be the maniscal killer he got a taste for when he was younger. Amogst these are the Blood Fury Tattoo and the Dagger of Endless Stabbing. Other utility items which made Bazvrah a force you never wanted to meet include: Mask of the Wild, Earth Terror, the Immovable Rod and even a Femur of Dave Bones.

### Blood Fury Tattoo
> Your attack rolls score a critical hit on a d20 roll of 19 or 20.
> When you score a critical hit against a creature, that target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.
> When a creature you can see damages you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature, with advantage on your attack roll.

###  Dagger of Endless Stabbing
> You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you roll a 20 to hit, you may make an additional attack.
> 
> Curse. Immediately after you successfully hit a creature with a melee attack using the dagger, make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you enter a stabbing frenzy and must use each turn to move to the nearest creature and use your action to make a melee attack with the dagger. If you have the extra attack feature, make as many attacks as each action will allow. Repeat the saving throw at the end of each turn, ending the frenzy on a success.

Thes two items allowed a blood fueled rage where repeated strikes against a single target could only be stopped by abnormal forces.
