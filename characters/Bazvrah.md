# Bazvrah

Bazvrah is a deadly assassin, a fusion of Druid, Rogue, and Cleric, driven by a singular goal‚Äîrevenge. His target is [Darmuth](/characters/Darmuth), whom he believes responsible for putting his brother, [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert), into a three-year coma. However, the truth is more complex; Bazzert fell into his slumber after drawing from the Deck of Many Things. With his newfound castle, granted by the same deck, Bazvrah established [The-Red-Keep](/organizations/The-Red-Keep), a ruthless assassin's training ground.

> "My brother was always a powerful spellcaster. I have spent my time mastering the art of assassination and infiltration. My father constantly meditated with my brother in our family shrine. One day, a local drunk burned the shrine, destroying our sanctuary. That drunk was my first kill. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to perfect this newfound craft.
>
> When my brother disappeared two years ago, I received a castle in the Jade Forest. I have since transformed it into a training ground for assassins, forging a collective force known as The Red Castle. We train the mind and body, preparing for the art of the kill.
>
> I vow to kill whoever made my brother disappear."

## Training & Methodology
Upon hearing of his brother's coma, Bazvrah dedicated himself to the Circle of the Moon Druid path, perfecting Wild Shape for covert operations. His transformations allowed him to scout targets unnoticed, exploiting their weaknesses with precision. His killing ritual was simple yet effective‚Äîutilizing his brother‚Äôs enchanted artifact, The Sleep Crown, he would force his targets into slumber before silently dispatching them with a psyhic dagger to the skull. A dagger which can could spawn with his mind.

His career as a hired killer honed his instincts, enabling him to react swiftly to any interference with his objectives. Whether through brute force or careful subterfuge, he always found a method to complete the job, growing ever more confident in his craft.

## Journey to Revenge
At the height of The Red Keep‚Äôs power, Mortis Lux sought Bazvrah‚Äôs expertise for an assassination mission against Darmuth. He joined the party, traveling by boat to [Wegate](/locations/Mardun/Wegate), with a stop in the Jade Forest to gather his resources. Along the way, he executed those who stood in his way, operating outside Mortis Lux‚Äôs reputation to ensure his personal vendetta remained unhindered.

This ruthless pursuit led to a confirmed hit list during his time with the party:

> **üìú The Hit List**
> #### **üü• Taken Off**
> 1. **Meade** ‚Äì For reminding him of an abusive drunk he once killed.
> 2. **Former Teammates** ‚Äì For abandoning him to the Frost Giants.
> 
> #### **üü® Active Targets**
> 1. **Thief** who exposed his position in Os‚Äôs city *(400g bounty)*.
> 2. **Incompetent Guard** in Fywick.
> 
> #### **‚úÖ Confirmed Kills**
> 1. **Italian dock worker** in Fywick.
> 2. **Steve-O** ‚Äì For being insufferable in Fywick.
> 3. **Steve Harvey** ‚Äì For attempting to con him in Free-Real-Estate Town.
> 4. **Kaltrsar Bay dock worker** ‚Äì For arguing about money.
> 

## Legacy of Death
Bazvrah's psychic powers, evident since childhood, allowed him to rack up over ten confirmed kills, including his very first as a young boy. With each successful assassination, he took a trophy‚Äîsomething tangible to remind him of his skills, his past, and his lost innocence.

> **üìø The Necklace of History**
> Bazvrah carries a leather cord adorned with relics from his kills, each a symbol of his deadly path:
> - ü¶∑ **Tooth of Ivory**
> - üå∫ **Small Iron Flower**
> - üêÖ **Tiger Claw**
> - üíç **Diamond Engagement Ring**
> - üîë **Safe Key**
> - üü© **Jade Statue**
> - üèÖ **Iron Token** *(Taken from the Italian Dock Master)*
> - üï∂Ô∏è **Steve-O's Glasses**
> - üëñ **Steve Harvey's Leather Belt Fragment**
> - üßî **Sylivian‚Äôs Beard Hair** *(A dock worker‚Äôs keepsake)*

This necklace serves as a grim testament to his journey, a weight of past sins and future vengeance resting upon his shoulders.

## Notable Traits and Items
Bazvrah's elite killing methods was due to a combination of traits and items which allowed him to be the maniacal killer. Amogst these are the Blood Fury Tattoo and the Dagger of Endless Stabbing. Other utility items which made Bazvrah a force you never wanted to meet include: The Soul Dagger(1d6+5), Mask of the Wild, Earth Terror, The Immovable Rod and even a Femur of [Dave Bones](/characters/Dave-Bones).

### ü©∏ Blood Fury Tattoo
> - Attack rolls **crit on 19 or 20**.
> - Critical hits deal **+4d6 necrotic damage**, granting temp HP equal to the damage dealt.
> - When damaged, you can **make an immediate melee attack** as a reaction.

### üó°Ô∏è Dagger of Endless Stabbing
> - **+2 bonus** to attack and damage rolls.
> - Rolling a **20 to hit grants an extra attack**.
> - **Curse:** Failing a DC 12 Wisdom save triggers a **stabbing frenzy**, forcing attacks on the nearest creature until another save succeeds.

‚ö†Ô∏è These items fueled a **blood-fueled rage**, giving Bazvrah a non-zero (albient extremly small) chance to kill any enemy outright.

## The End of Bazvrah
Upon the discover of the [Library-Dimension](/locations/Library-Dimension), Bazvrah made immidiate note of two things, the Assassination Guild and the Tree of Knowledge. As travel through the dimension becomes increasingly difficult due to the long distances between areas and the parties fear of being lost out of time grew, Bazvrah made a devision to try to blend himeself innto the Tree and attempt to travel long distance amongst its root system. Being a druid he knew the spell `Tree Stride`. Upon entering the [Tree-of-Knowledge](/characters/Tree-of-Knowledge) Bazvrah fused with the tree and took over the position. 

üå± **Final Fate:** Over many years, the Tree consumed Bazvrah‚Äôs personality, erasing him from time‚Äîleaving behind only the knowledge he contributed.

> **Tree Stride** *(5th Level, 1 Action, Self, V/S, Concentration 1 Minute, Conjuration, No Attack/Save, Movement Effect)*
> You gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you're in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.
