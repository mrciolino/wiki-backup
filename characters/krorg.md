# Origin
Krorg Bearstealer, formerly known as Gilthur, was an unusually large gnome. Born in the town of North Geskoworm to a single mother after his half-elf father skipped town when his child support payments became too numerous. As an adult Gilthur decided to become a bard and try his luck in the gnomish standup comedian circut. His career came to an end when he told a joke that was so foul and awful that it resulted in him being banished forever. Gilthur brought such shame to his people that they were forced to magically obscure the name of his place of birth, from North Geskoworm to Krorg's Hometown. Gilthur travelled south until he came across the party and joined them in their adventure.

Very shortly after joining, Gilthur was bitten by a wolf. Somehow this caused him to completely forget his previous identity as a bard named Gilthur and became a barbarian. No longer remembering his name, but knowing he hailed from a place called Krorg's Hometown, he took the name Krorg. 

# Timeskip
During the 3 year time skip, Krorg was hard at work refinancing the struggling new pirate kingdom with a new fiat currency Bombcoin. Despite giving Os the world's largest bounty, Krorg was unable to stop him from cutting off the entire southern continent from trade and sending Alford into a deep trade deficit. Desparate times call for desparate measures, and Krorg entered into a political marriage with a wealthy merchant family from the east. Krorg was able to save Alford from ruin, and his wife Kayla bore a son named Krorgfrey. However, he achieved this by liquidating his wife's family's assets turning them from a mighty trading company into a single far off hamlet. 

# Death...

During his rise to king, Krorg had made many enemies and many people wanted him dead. He was eventually betrayed by several key figures, who acted after Krorg had sent most of his old party away to the southern continent to assassinate Os. An anti-Krorgist coalition consisting of pirate captains, old nobles, and Krorg's inlaws revealed his location to Darmouth, and lowered the city's defenses to allow her and her pet inside. As Krorg was communicating with the party via speaking stone as they captured Os, Darmouth broke in and attacked. With all of his guards gone, Krorg attempted to reason with, bribe, and eventually seduce Darmouth, who ended up feeding him to her pet. Darmouth renegged on her promise to only kill Krorg, and opened Alford to slaughter by her bone spiders. 

# ...is Never the End
Somehow Krorg has returned from beyond the grave under the pseudonym "The Prophet of Profit" and amassed a large following of people on a crusade to destroy all gold. But once again he overplayed his hand and earned the wrath of Zeus.
