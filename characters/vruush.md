### **Background**  
- **Clan:** Norixius.  
- **Era:** Ancient (exact time unclear, likely centuries before 1000 AD).  
- **Goal:** Prove himself by slaying a dragon alone.  

### **The Curse of Vruush**  
- Adventuring groups he joined would **thrive while he was with them** but suffer **total annihilation after he left**.  
- Over time, parties refused to take him, fearing the "curse."  

### **The Legend of Three Tips Gorge**  
#### **The Setup**  
- **Location:** Three Tips Gorge (a valley in Cairnheim with rich gold/silver deposits).  
- **Dragon Inhabitants:**  
  - Two ancient dragons (blue & green).  
  - Two adult red dragons.  
  - Kobold minions served the ancients.  

#### **The Trap**  
- Vruush **tricked a merchant caravan** into being bait, luring the dragons into a fight.  
- **Unexpected Fourth Dragon:** A wandering ancient green dragon joined the battle.  

#### **The Battle**  
- A **week-long war** erupted:  
  - Dragons unleashed fire, poison, and lightning.  
  - Kobolds swarmed the battlefield.  
  - **Earth elementals** awakened, enraged by the destruction.  
- Vruush’s party was wiped out except for **Sotha of Yori (a halfling)**.  

#### **The Climax**  
- Vruush chased the surviving dragons to a mountain peak.  
- **All died**—Vruush, the two ancient dragons—but the details are lost.  

### **Aftermath & Legacy**  
- **The Halberd of Vruush:**  
  - Recovered by Clan Norixius, stained with **three types of dragon blood**.  
  - Now a sacred relic, "proof" he killed all four dragons (though likely embellished).  
- **The Gorge’s Fate:**  
  - Reduced to a wasteland by earth spirits.  
  - A symbol of Vruush’s destructive glory.  

### **Cultural Impact**  
- Clan Norixius **mythologizes him** as the ultimate dragon slayer.  
- His story is used to inspire younger warriors.  
- The **"Curse of Vruush"** remains a cautionary tale among adventurers.
