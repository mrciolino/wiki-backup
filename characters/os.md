# Os Vrtnica


## Reaction to The Death of Bomb The Bear
For Os, it made him recognize how fleeting life could be and how little control he had. It was the first of many losses, whether it be of party members, old friends or trusted battle comrades. As the losses piled up, Os did everything he could to grasp control. He can stop time, cheat death, and has even ascended to Godhood. Aloof as he is, Os feels the pain of loss and has built himself up to prevent it alongside Spoops, now his oldest and most trusted comrade.
