# Odin
Head of the Norse pantheon. Odin rules his pantheon of Gods from Asgard. He also has a seat on the Council of Gods.


# Encounters

## First Encounter
The party first meets Odin upon arrival in Asgard to train and plan for the war against the Ithilids. 

As agreed upon in the treaty, The Council of Gods would assist Mortis
Lux in their war against the Ithilids, one part of thst agreement was dorect intervention by the Council. The council assigned Orin, Thor, and Loki to the task.

To prepare for the battle, Odin agreed to help train the party and troops on killing titans and fighting in general. Also he provided the party with a horn thst would summon the three Norse gods to the battlefield when the party required.

## Ithilid War
As the final battle was raging, and the party encountered Ceremorph-Zeus outside the Emperor's throne room, Spoops blew the horn to summon the Norse gods.

Odin and the others joined the fight. However even they had a great deal of trouble due to their inablility to target Zeus and Zeus' immunity to magic. Their avatars died multiple times throughout the fight. While their avatars may have been continupusly dying, Spoops, and Breezy-E kept blowing the horn to being them back. 

The party finished off Zeus and upon facing the Emperor, Orin finally made himself useful, forcibly teleporting the party, Gods, Emperor, and Ithilid Creature to the 
Elemental plane of Chaos. In doing so, he was able to interrupt the environmental effects of the Ithillid creature, allowing the party to begin their attack on the Emperor.
