# Rabiah
A storm giant woman living in the [Elemental Plane of Chaos](/locations/elemental-plane-of-chaos). She set up shop around the [Spawning Stone](/locations/elemental-plane-of-chaos/spawning-stone) where she uses the growing pillar of mithril to produce powerful golems. She sells these golems to a select clientele. One of her clients is the devil [Raphael](/characters/raphael).


## Meeting Spoops
Rabiah met Spoops when the [Low Bar Brawlers](/organizations/low-bar-brawlers) were [searching the elemental plane of chaos](/Events/the-spawning-stone-and-rabiah) for massive gemstones.
