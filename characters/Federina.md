# Frederina
One of the original LBB adventurers.
Killed Illiard for no reason.
Krorg didn't like her, and after he became king, gave her a pirate ship to find the furthest point on Mardun from Altricia.
Original owner of the flying pirate ship that the party used a bunch
Got 1v1'd by Meade and killed in fywick.
lobster god (final boss) was her patron but never told anyone about it
Could never remember what was going on in the sessions
Some other lore stuff ryan needs to put
