## Backstory

One of the original LBB adventurers.
Killed Illiard for no reason.
Krorg didn't like her, and after he became king, gave her a pirate ship to find the furthest point on Mardun from Altricia.
Original owner of the flying pirate ship that the party used a bunch
Got 1v1'd by Meade and killed in fywick.
lobster god (final boss) was her patron but never told anyone about it
Could never remember what was going on in the sessions
Some other lore stuff ryan needs to put

## Spells
Somehow through shear patron disbelief, Federina has `three Cantrips, five 1st Level Spells, zero 2nd Level Spells, zero 3rd Level Spells, one 4th Level Spell and one 5th Level Spell`. Maybe the most untapped potential of a character who can skip from 1st to 4th level spells.
