# Origin
"The Promise of Death" also known as "Mort" to the party, is an ancient Yugoloth assassin from Assassin Mountain. It was a contract demon that served as an agent to the mountain, often sent on the most difficult assassination missions. As a shapeshifter it would assume any number of appearances to better serve its goals, goals set forth by the mountain that were impossible to break or bend. TPoD was selected to serve forth Krorg's Conditional Contract to kill whoever was responsible for his death, and was dispatched to kill Darmuth after Krorg died. 

## Da Rulez
TPoD followed the following rules on every mission:
1. No killing except for the target, unless they get in the way of your mission.
2. Once the decision to kill has been made it cannot be unmade.

## Krorg's Conditional Contract
While he was under suspicion that someone would try to kill him, Krorg made a contract with Assassin Mountain.

> 20,000 gold.
> If I am killed, you are ordered to kill whoever is responsible for my death.
> - Krorg Bearstealer, King of Altricia

# Time with the party
Realizing the best chance to destroy Darmuth would be to join the Low Bar Brawlers, TPoD took on the identity of a kindly old man named "Mort" in order to gain their trust quickly. Mort travelled with the party as a cheeful old man, none of them realizing the evil that had joined them (except for Achilles who after taking off Mort's hat saw his true face while he was sleeping). There was a moment that Mort was assigned to kill Spoops but the paperwork wasn't filed correctly at the office so the order got shelved. Eventually the party did come across Darmuth and Mort went in for the kill, but unfortunately she escaped. 

# Departure
While TPoD was after Darmuth, the assassin actuaries of assassin mountain relooked over Krorg's Conditional Contract. Darmuth's pet is the one who killed Krorg, but did so at the order of Darmuth. Culpability of Krorg's death was Darmuth, or was it? Altricia had a sizeable defense against large monsters and lich with a standing army of pirates and a fortified castle. The Assassin Actuary's further investigation lead to the uncovering of the anti-krorgist faction and their plot to get Krorg killed, and the alliance they made with Darmuth. Given some creative legal reinterpretation as well as satisfaction over what Assassin Mountain percieved as a bad deal on their part (20k gold for a lich was way too low), the head lawyers of Assassin Mountain shifted culpability from Darmuth to the anti-krorgist faction who were mostly already dead from Darmuth. 

So in a single moment TPoD no longer needed to fight Darmuth, and so it left without a word to kill the final surviving anti-krorgist: the former Queen of Altricia, Kayla.

- **Detached**: TPoD views life and death through a lens of obligation, seeing its missions as mere tasks rather than moral choices.

- **The Contract is Law**: Once a contract is made, it is inviolable. TPoD believes that the sanctity of a contract is paramount, and breaking it is unforgivable.

- **The Low Bar Brawlers**: Despite its mission, TPoD has developed a begrudging respect for the Low Bar Brawlers, except for Achilles.
## Flaws:

- **Overconfident**: TPoD thought it could defeat both Darmuth and Spoops at one point.
- **Emotional Void**: TPoD has difficulty understanding or relating to emotions, making it seem cold and distant even when trying to blend in.
