# Luther
He was one of Spoops' first paladin recruits. 

# Encounters

## Origin
A man, born and raised in [Bahyrst](/locations/Mardun/Bahyrst). 

## First Encounter
Luther was first encoutnered by the [Low Bar Brawlers](/organizations/low-bar-brawlers) in campaign 1 when he became one of [Spoops'](/characters/spoops) original paladin recruits in Bahyrst. He joined after [Kierkegaard](/characters/kierkegaard) and trained under Spoops. Together he and the other paladin recruits purified the water and cured the outbreak of lycanthropy in Bahyrst.


## Preparations For The Ithilid War
Luther was granted command over 10 ships. He was tasked with gathering Ithilid parts to be used to make mind blank potions. He gathered a really fucking small amount. He needed to pick up the pace so the party sent Tony Mozzarella to accompany him and establish trade relations with some merchants and lords who they freed from enslavement by the Ithilids.
    

## The Ithilid War
During the [Ithilid war](/Events/ithilid-war), like the other original paladin recruits, Luther held a high rank as a general of Mortis Lux. He held command over a fleet of ships during the battle.

During the war, his fleet was sent to defend [Altricia](/locations/Mardun/Allford). His bravery and valor in defense of the city earned him the trust and respect of the people and [Krorg's](/characters/krorg) royal family.

After the war, Krorg granted him regency over the city and left it in his care.
