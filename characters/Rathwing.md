# Trivia

#### Day of Rath
[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Lieutenant of the lich, executor of her will,  
With every act of evil, his heart grows colder still.  
Invisible, he moves, then strikes with fire from the void,  
A dance of shadow and flame, life itself shall be destroyed.
[Chorus]  
Day of Rath, the skies bleed red,  
With fireballs and shadows dance with dread.  
He strikes unseen, with deadly grace,  
Leaving nothing left in his merciless embrace.  
[Verse 2]
From the depths of despair, in the lair of the bear,  
He conjured his gold, an attack without compare.  
Bomb met his end, not a chance to defend,  
Against Rathwing, no one else can contend.
[Chorus]
Day of Rath, the world hides in fright,  
From underneath the shadow of his might.  
The tales of his tyranny, whispered in fear,  
Remind us of that always the ending lurks near.
[Epic Hurdy-Gurdy Solo]
[Verse 3]
Saragossa's cries, beneath blood-red skies,  
He watched it burn, with his very own eyes.  
City of pirates, lost to the sea,  
Rathwing's laughter, their last decree.
[Chorus]
Day of Rath, the end draws near,  
His laughter, the last thing that you'll ever hear.  
In his wake, only ashes remain,
A testament to his endless campaign.
[Instrumental Outro]
