# Encounters
## Origin
A satyr, born and raised in Bahryst. 

## First Encounter
Ghazali was first encoutnered by the party in canpaign 1 when he becsme one of Spoops' original paladin recruits in Bahryst. He joined after Kierkegaard and trained under Spoops. Together he and the other paladin recruits purified the eater and cured the outbreak of lycanthropy in Bahryst.


## Prophet of Profit (Campaign)
As Mortis Lux was forming back on Mardun, Spoops ordered Ghazali to acquire funds for the organization. Ghazali joined up with a band of arventurers to acquire some gold after receiving an invitation from the mysterious Prophet of Profit. 


## Ascention to Archangel
The operation fell apart in the end, and Ghazali ended up lost in the wilderness around Sigil, surviving alone until Spoops called on him for a status update. As punishment for his failure, and reward for his servitude and loyalty, Spoops tranformed Ghazali into his first Archangel. He was dubbed the Archangel of Atonement and provided a powerful greataxe forged by Bazzdos.

## Treaty With The Council of Gods
Ghazali joined the party as Spoops' attendant during their meeting with the Council of Gods. 

## The Ithilid War
During the Ithilid war, like the other original paladin recruits, Ghazali held a high rank as a general of Mortis Lux. He held command over a fleet of ships during the battle.
