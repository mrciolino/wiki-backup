# Encounters
## Origin
A satyr, born and raised in [Bahyrst](/locations/Mardun/Bahyrst). 

## First Encounter
Ghazali was first encoutnered by the [Low Bar Brawlers](/organizations/low-bar-brawlers) in campaign 1 when he became one of [Spoops'](/characters/spoops) original paladin recruits in Bahyrst. He joined after [Kierkegaard](/characters/kierkegaard) and trained under Spoops. Together he and the other paladin recruits purified the water and cured the outbreak of lycanthropy in Bahyrst.


## Prophet of Profit (Campaign)
As Mortis Lux was forming back on Mardun, Spoops ordered Ghazali to acquire funds for the organization. Ghazali joined up with a band of arventurers to acquire some gold after receiving an invitation from the mysterious Prophet of Profit. He ended up dying during the adventure, acquiring nothing. 


## Ascention to Archangel
The operation fell apart in the end, and Ghazali ended up dying, but as a paladin of Spoops he came back from the dead only to become lost in the wilderness around Sigil, surviving alone until Spoops called on him for a status update. As punishment for his failure, and reward for his servitude and loyalty, Spoops tranformed Ghazali into his first Archangel. He was dubbed the Archangel of Atonement and provided a powerful greataxe forged by Bazzdos.

## Treaty With The Council of Gods
Ghazali joined the party as Spoops' attendant during their meeting with the Council of Gods. 

## The Ithilid War
During the Ithilid war, like the other original paladin recruits, Ghazali held a high rank as a general of Mortis Lux. He held command over a fleet of ships during the battle.
