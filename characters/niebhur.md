# Niebhur
He was one of Spoops' first paladin recruits. He was tasked with gathering precious metals for Mortis Lux. He also negotiated with and acted as ambassador to the space dwarves.

# Encounters

## Origin
A man, born and raised in [Bahyrst](/locations/Mardun/Bahyrst). 

## First Encounter
Niebhur was first encoutnered by the [Low Bar Brawlers](/organizations/low-bar-brawlers) in campaign 1 when he became one of [Spoops'](/characters/spoops) original paladin recruits in Bahyrst. He joined after [Kierkegaard](/characters/kierkegaard) and trained under Spoops. Together he and the other paladin recruits purified the water and cured the outbreak of lycanthropy in Bahyrst.


## Preparations For The Ithilid War
Niebhur was put in command of 10 ships. He was sent to get materials for imprisoning cronos. He was to establish mines for platinum, silver, and gold, but needed to negotiate with astral dwarf clans to acquire the materials. The party sent him with troops and funds to help negotiate.

## The Ithilid War
During the [Ithilid war](/Events/ithilid-war), like the other original paladin recruits, Niebhur held a high rank as a general of Mortis Lux. He held command over a fleet of ships during the battle.
