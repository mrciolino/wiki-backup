<h1>Bomb the Bear</h1>
<p>Bomb the Bear was a brown cave bear would become the second ally to join the LBB party (after Freedom) and his death would become a pivotal moment in the entire plot.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>Bomb lived in a cave near [[Fort Suro]] and slept in a room with a treasure chest. Exactly who this treasure belonged to or why Bomb was guarding it are mysteries lost to time. When the party first discovered the room, they decided to sneak around quietly as to not wake the bear. However this slow rate of progress annoyed Krorg who decided to wrestle Bomb while the party grabbed the loot. After the treasure chest was emptied, Krorg suplexed Bomb into the chest which was then locked by Os Vrintia. The chest containing Bomb would be hauled away.</p>
<h2>Bomb Joins the Party</h2>
<p>After some time Krorg and Os decide to release Bomb from the chest and see if he'd leave them or stay for food. Bomb decided to stay and the world was forever changed. Going to Kaltozar Bay, Bomb needed to be disguised as a person to be let into the city. Afterwards, Bomb joined Krorg in his fight against Freedom, the two of them managing to carry and fire a cannon while aboard a pirate ship. Lastly, Bomb joined the battle against Rathwing and the raid on Rathwing's Fortress.</p>
<h2>The Death of Bomb the Bear</h2>
<p>Bomb fought valiantly with the party against an enormous number of foes. Unfortunately Krorg got impatient again and taunted the cultists to send out their leader as they were too weak to fight for themselves. Rathwing entered the scene and using <code>animate object</code> he turned a handful of coins into a swarm of flying sawblades and cut Bomb to pieces. The party fought Rathwing into retreating but the true damage had been done. Bomb was dead, and so Krorg buried him outside the fortress, marking his grave with the blades of all the cultists that were killed. From that moment, Krorg decided to get his revenge on Gold for taking the Bomb's life, and Spoops vowed to never let a friend die ever again. These two misguided crusades would define the rest of the campaign for better or worse.</p>
<h2>Bombcoin</h2>
<p>Bomb was near and dear in the hearts of many party members, and in his anti-gold crusade Krorg decided to issue a new fiat currency called Bombcoin which was not backed by physical gold. This running joke went too far and it resulted in widespread adoption of Bombcoin by all manner of economies throughout the multiverse. After Spoops freed Bomb's soul (unsure what exactly happened here) and caused Bombcoin to crash to 0, he spurred the wrath of many powerful formerly wealthy individuals, most notably Zeus.</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Bomb's grave is still north of Altricia, and presumably undisturbed. Bomb has expressed no interest in returning to the world as he died a noble hero's death. His memory lives on through many tales and songs, for his story is one of the power that a single life can hold over the entire world. It is unclear if Bomb ever had children or possessed any hidden agendas or personalities besides being smarter than the average cave bear.&nbsp;</p>
