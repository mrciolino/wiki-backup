## **Backstory: The Lies of Profeta**  
Elira was an **Inkling** for the cult-like religion of **Profeta**, where gifted individuals were indoctrinated to serve as living propaganda machines. Born with a ringlet tattoo on her ankle, she was taken from her family and subjected to brutal testsâ€”including being ordered to kill her own parents. Those who obeyed were slaughtered, while those who refused were deemed "worthy" and forced into servitude.  

- **The Truth Revealed**: Elira and her closest friend, **Anya**, realized Profeta was a fraudâ€”no gods dictated their tattoos, only control.  
- **Escape & Betrayal**: They fled to the **Rabble Mob**, a traveling theater troupe, using their ink magic for performances instead of manipulation.  
- **Diavalaâ€™s Wrath**: The "mythical" goddess **Diavala**â€”whom they thought didnâ€™t existâ€”proved horrifyingly real. She possessed allies, driving them to madness, and demanded Eliraâ€™s obedience.  
- **Dimensional Flight**: To protect her new family, Elira fled through a portal to **Mardune**, landing in the **Mortis Lux** universe.  

> *"She knew the moment she killed Anya that Diavala would just possess someone else. But she had no choice."*

## **Arrival in Mardune**  
Crash-landing on a beach, Elira was immediately swept into chaos:  
- **First Encounter**: Met **Spoops**, a dimension-hopping rogue, and an angelic figure resembling *Castiel from Supernatural*.  
- **Trial by Cosmic Court**: Accused of unlawful dimension travel, she and Spoops tricked the judges and escaped.  
- **Portal Chaos**: Hopped through multiple dimensions before reuniting with the **Mortis Lux** party at the **College of Porthy**.
