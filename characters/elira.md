## Story  

### The Inklingâ€™s Truth  
Elira Aniveshak is an Inkling for the esteemed religion of **Profeta**. Using magic, Inklings tattoo followers with beautiful images that represent the Divineâ€™s will and guide the actions of the recipients.  

> *Itâ€™s considered a noble calling, but ten years into her servitude, Elira knows the truth:*  
> - Profeta is built on **lies**.  
> - The tattooed orders **strip away freedom**.  
> - The revered temple is actually a **brutal, torturous prison**.  

### Escape & The Rabble Mob  
Her opportunity to escape arrives with the **Rabble Mob**, a traveling theater troupe. Using her inkling abilities for performance instead of propaganda, Elira is content for the first time...  

> *Until she realizes who followed them.*  

### The Divine Threat  
The Divine she never believed in, **Diavala**, is very real, very angry, and determined to use Elira and the Rabble Mobâ€™s now-infamous stage to spread her deceitful influence even further.  

### A New Dimension, A New Battle  
To protect her new family from the wrath of a **malicious deity** and the zealots who work in her name, she **escapes to another dimension** to draw Diavala away from her homeworld and the people she loves.  

Now she must find a way to **stop Diavala**, all while being tangled up in an **odd group of strangers**, with new adventures and adversaries awaiting her.
