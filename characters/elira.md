# written backstory
Elira Aniveshak is an Inkling for the esteemed religion of Profeta. Using magic, Inklings tattoo followers with beautiful images that represent the Divineâ€™s will and guide the actions of the recipients. Itâ€™s considered a noble calling, but ten years into her servitude, Elira knows the truth: Profeta is built on lies, the tattooed orders strip away freedom, and the revered temple is actually a brutal, torturous prison.


Her opportunity to escape arrives with the Rabble Mob, a traveling theater troupe. Using her inkling abilities for performance instead of propaganda, Elira is content for the first time . . . until she realizes who followed them. The Divine she never believed in, Diavala, is very real, very angry, and determined to use Elira and the Rabble Mobâ€™s now-infamous stage to spread her deceitful influence even further.


To protect her new family from the wrath of a malicious deity and the zealots who work in her name, she escapes to another dimension to draw Diavala away from her home world and the people she loves. Now she must find a way to stop Diavala, all the while being tangled up in an odd group of strangers, with new adventures and adversaries awaiting her.
