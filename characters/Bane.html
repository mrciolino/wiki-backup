<h1>Bane</h1>
<p>A well known god of Faer√ªn as the face of pure evil through malevolent despotism. Can check out his page on <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bane">Forgotten Realms</a>. To <a href="/organizations/mortis-lux">Mortis Lux </a>however, Bane is a much different creature, one of unrelentless tricks and treachery.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>We first met Bane when he was known to us as The Witch King.</p>
