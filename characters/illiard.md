# Lucidel Illiard
Illiard was the top wizard of Alford and major advisor to the king. He lived in a tower within the city. He had an apprentice who turned evil. He had skills as an artificer and created a warforged companion named Freedom. He was also concered about Rathwing and set out to have an adventuring party take care of him before he became a bigger threat. Unfortunately he was killed by Frederina just before Drakham set bone spiders upon Alford, so he never saw any of his plans get realized. 

According to crazy conspiracy theorists he made a second warforged named Oppression as a counterpart to Freedom, as an experiment to see if Chaos or Order was better.
