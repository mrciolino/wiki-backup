# Ayod
[Bazzert's](/characters/bazzert) druid master.

## Disappearing Stars
During their journey to [investigate cult activity](/Events/traveling-to-demsford) in [Demsford](/locations/Mardun/demsford), [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) and [Krorg](/characters/krorg) encountered Ayod in an underwater cave. Ayod told them that he discovered that the stars are disappearing. He also provided Bazzert with the [Book on Killing Gods](/items/How-To-Kill-Gods).
