# Origin
Spoops is an ancient Primordial entity who first awoke in timeless time within his Divine Realm the Well of Souls. He is the God of Souls although he often equates that to being the god of life and death. Throughout his existence he has been known by many names and titles, including Myrkul God of Death, Avatar of Ry-ann, Grandmaster Paladin, His Holiness, The Crusader, and others. During the Ithilid War he has taken physical form as Spoops, one of the original Low Bar Brawlers, and a founding member Mortis Lux.

# Creation of the Universe
In the beginning, AO created the Universe. While AO was busy shaping the cosmos, creating the realms and astral sea, a door opened. A skeleton named Spoops peered out from the doorway to his Soulwell, beholding the majesty of creation as AO twisted and forged reality around him, Spoops spoke, "Hello there! The names Spoops! Who might you be?" to which AO took notice, turned to face spoops, and putting his hand on the door AO slowly closed it saying "Shhhhhh, no interruptions." Spoops had some trouble getting the door open for a while after that....

Spoops spent the next era within his realm devastatingly bored, his only company being the countless souls contained within his Soulwell. After some time Spoops noticed his well of souls beginning to move. What was once a swarming pillar of unmoving souls began to infinitely flow. Intrigued by this he decided to investigate. Eventually he was able to unjam the door and found himself looking down upon a great battle between two massive Goddesses who he would later know as Selune and Shar. Upon Seeing them, he called out to the dark haired one, "Hey big ladies!" he shouted through the chaos. For but a moment they looked his way and the dark haired one winked before continuing to beat the ever loving light out of the silver haired goddess. Spoops decided it best to close the door again and come back out once the fighting was done.

# Time of Troubles
For a time Spoops was known as Myrkul and adventured with Bane and Bhaal before their ascention to Godhood. During this period of time, Spoops and his allies were responsible for the events which led to the Time of Troubles. At the end of these events, Spoops's Avatar was destroyed by Cyric who seized much of his domain of Death. Then Spoops was suddenly confronted by AO who without a word, threw Spoops into the sea of a world in the mortal realm. However, while Spoops was indeed thrown down to the mortal realm, his inseperable connection to the Well of Souls remained. This resulted in the Splitting of his essence into two entities: Ry-ann the God who retained domain over Souls and Godly knowledge, and Spoops the Skeleton whos memories were replaced by knowledge of the very thing AO cast him into, water.


# Glubglub The Immortal's Invasion
After losing his memories and washing ashore in an unfamiliar land, Spoops lived and trained as a Paladin in an ancient city of High Elves. While wielding his trusty blade "The Cleanser", he drove back an invasion by the Crab God Glubglub by sealing their minion Jormungandr in a giant crystal in the city's castle. Unfortunately the city was sunk beneath the waves. As he is swept away, Spoop's memory becomes hazy again and he disappears from the world.



# Lich Wars
Spoops found himself washed ashore in a new world engulfed in war. As a group of Liches waged war on the world, Spoops found himself on the side of the living. After washing ashore, despite being a skeleton in a time when the undead were of particular concern, Spoops used his quick wit and determination to befriend the local community. However after his new home was demolished by the command of the Liches, he swore vengeance and departed with a surviving cleric to join up with the Paladins in the nearest city. Over many years, Spoops worked his way up to the level of Grandmaster Paladin. Commanding the forces of a legion of paladins, they departed in their ships accross the sea to meet their enemies in battle. However a rogue cell of paladins existed within the order who sought Spoops' downfall. During their voyage, they saw their opportunity to strike as Spoops contemplated the movements of the waves. With a deft hand they struck Spoops down, leaving him murdered and sinking into the depths of the sea.

# Arrival to the Modern Era (Start of the Low Bar Brawlers)
Spoops once again found himself washed ashore missing most of his memories. This time he was not far from where he last sank into the sea, still finding himself within the kingdom of Kaltrussar. He remembered that he was a Paladin, and was wearing some of his basic gear. He dried himself off in the sun before walking into the nearest tavern for a drink. It was in this tavern that he finds himself joining up with 11 others to form the Low Bar Brawlers.


# Timeskip Arc

After the fall of Altricia to Darmuth and the death of Krorg at her hands. The party split up to gather their strength and take care of their own individual tasks before reuniting to face Darmuth again. Spoops spent two years working with Vesrahaan in Wegate forming the rebel army, and spreading worship of Spoops/Ry-ann among the population.

Spoops traveled to Wegate with Lokunai the demon, where he had already sent his disciple Vesrahann the snake woman to preach of his coming as the Prophet of their true god. Spoops, Lokunai, and Vesrahann sought to establish a new church of Ry-ann led by the Pope/king Spoops. After their arrival, Spoops spent his the time in Wegate converting followers to his cause to create a pseudo-theorcracy around himself as the holy Prophet of Death and life. 

At the end of the two years, Spoops kust leave the rebels to meet with the party. He leaves Vesrahaan to lead his followers as he makes his way back to his friends.


# Founding of Mortis Lux
After the fall of Darmuth, and the realization that she was only the vanguard in what was almost a world-shattering invasion. Spoops and the rest of the party looked to the sky and saw the massive crack above altricia. They had prevented something massive from shattering the world's crystal sphere, but the enemy was still out there in the Astral Plane, coming for their world. 
Spoops suggested to the party that this task was bigger than just the Low Bar Brawlers, and a larger organization would be needed to face their true enemy, dubbed the Ithilids and their Creature. He suggested they seek out their old allies and forge an alliance led by the Low Bar Brawlers, to combat the Ithilids wherever they were on any plane. The party agreed, and set to work recruiting members from multiple worlds and planes. 


# Ithillid War 
During the final war against the Ithillids, Spoops mustered the full force of Mortis Lux and their allies and devised a plan of attack. Step one of the plan was for Breezy-e and a small elite force to pilot the Penne-trator Missile to the city on the head of the Ithillid's Creature. Then Spoops commanded their warships to form up into three waves, the first would portsl into the battlefield and begin a heavy assault on the Nautiloids around the creature. The second wave would engage Nautiloids when needed but woulr primarily make their way to the creature to engage it and the Ithillids directly, This second wave would carry the party whos goal was to find and eliminate the Emperor. Finally the third wave would portal in and fly above the Nautiloids, dropping troops to land on enemy ships and engage Ithollids in melee combat. Spoops also put his paladins in command of the defense of various cities which were being attacked by Nautiloids and tentacles of the creature.

During the assault Spoops was stationed with the rest of the party on their command ship whwre they blasted through thr battlefield using their lasers. Upon their arrival to the city atop the beast's head, they fired all lasers to attempt to tunnel into its brain to kill it. The lawer attack caused countless tentscles to emerge from the beast's flesh, ripping their ship apart. Before the ship fell, all aboard managed to mount the Mechatarasque as they fell into the opening they created in the creature's head. Spoops managed to grab ahold of the main laser and power supply before using Peace Was Never an Option to descend into the city. 

Spoops beheld the chaos before hom as the tentacles writed and flesh heaved. He tried to contact the party via speaking stone but could not get a message through. He resolved to follow them into the wound and find them, he flew upwards, hauling the massive laser into the air, then redirecting into the wound he fired the laser, dodging tentacles and burjing into the flesh of the beast. He managed to dig his way down, eventually finding a system of tunnels. Rather than waste time exploring he began using the laser to blast his way through. After going deeper he finally accudentally blaster a hole into a wider cavern where he found Knott Emportent and the rest of his party. Together they proceeded deeper into the creature until coming upon the golden lobster who directed them to a portal. 

Upon entering the portal, they found themselves in a massive hall within the creature. Within the hall they saw crystal pillars encapsulating many old friends. Before they coild free them, from the sides of the room emerged two enourmous enemies and an sickening sight, the Ceremorphised head of Zeus emerged from the tunnel below attacking the party. 

During the battle, Spoops did massive damage and was able to eliminate one of the two creatures. Ceremorph-Zeus was far more difficult, especially after Bazzdos accudentally ran into the Emperor's room alone and emerged mind controlled against the party. After finding that Zeus could not be tergeted by attacks and was immune to magic, Spoops sought to weaken him by contacting the Council of gods and asking warning them of his plan. He then used the Pen of Jergal to Kill all worshippers of Zeus. The he asked the Raven Queen to begin removing the memories of Zeus from all living and dead, including the Gods. The Council of Gods sat in stunned silence as they realized what Spoops had done. He had just begin the slow agonizing process of "executing" a God. This would slowly begin to drain Zeus's divine power and cause him to fade.

Spoops then realised this "Execution" would not be enough to stop him during the fight. Spoops grabbed the laser and positioned himself opposite Bazzdos with Zeus between them. He then fired his laser, targetting Bazzdos. Zeus who happened to be between them was grazed and injured by this powerful beam of non-magical damage! Then Bazzdos who was riding his Mechatarasque used its Armor plating to deflect the laser back at Spoops who did the same with his Mirror Shield. This "laser ping pong" struck Zeus eith every pass, doing immense damage each time. Eventually Zeus succumbed to his wounds and his divine soul was freed. Zeus thanked Spoops for freeing him before returning home, Spoops flipped that bitch off.

With Zeus defeated, the party freed their remaining friends who were held captive in the crystal pillars, sending them back to HQ via gate. Then they made their way to the next room where the Emperor was waiting.

Finally the final battle began, the party found themselves at one end of an immense hallway, the Emperor st thr other and hundreds of enemies in between. The Emperor gloated that they were too late and began his spell to reshape reality as they wished. He party realized they did not have time to fight through the hall, resist the Ithillid's creatures Abilities, and deal with the emepror's powerfull spells. Odin used a powerful spell to forcibly teleport the party, Creature and Emperor to the elemental plane of chaos near the Spawning Stone. He positioned the creature directly in front of the rapidly growing pillar of matter which impaled the giant creature, killing it. The party was now free to engage the Emperor directly. Breezy-e mentioned to the party the vision he received long ago about the crystals being the weakness of the emperor. Spoops and the party began their attack, destroying the crysyals breaking the power of the crown. This caused the crown to begin pulsing with waves of magical energy. It was clear that the crown would soon explode with devastating power. Spoops enlarged to maximum size to move quickly. He made use of his immense size to maneuver behind the Emperor and stab them with the Spelldrinker blade. This attack combined with the 12th level spell: Divine Command, allowed him to force the Emperor to submit to his will. He demanded the Emperor stop he blast, however the Emperor admitted they would be unable to do so. Out of time, Spoops looked to Breezy-e who spoke "Omae Wa Mou Shindeiru" before beginning a chain attack which executed the Emperor. With only a few moments to spare, Spoops had no time to fly over to the party to gate to safety. He yelled to them "get of here I can take it!" as the blast went off. The rest of the party gated to safety while Spoops was able to negate much of the blast with his anti-magic armor and jump into the Well of uis divine realm. 

As the door to his realm closed behind him, the blast caused hin to knock his head on the  well, separating his divine soul from his body again. He gave his body the info they needed to go ok another adventure while he contscted the rest of the party to say his goodbyes. With thr fight finally over, as per the Treaty with the Council of Gods, Spoops had to fulfil his atonement immediately. There was no time for him to physically rejoin the party for any celebrations. He entrusted many magic items to Bazzdos to seal away in labrinths and vaults designed to test the worthiness of adventurers brave enough to seek them out. He entrusted a few to Breezy-e as well. 

Spoops' final act among the party was sending each of them a goblet of ale and a note thanking them for the adventure of a lifetime. The party enjoyed one final bittersweet drink together before saying goodbye to the Low Bar Brawlers.
