Son of Odin and Norse pantheon god of Mischief. He resides in Asgard. He also has a seat on the Council of Gods. Alongside his Father Odin and brother Thor.


# Encounters

## First Encounter
The party first meets Loki at a "dinner party" hosted by Obox Ob in the Abyss. 

## Preparations for War
As agreed upon in the treaty, The Council of Gods would assist Mortis Lux in their war against the Ithilids, one part of thst agreement was dorect intervention by the Council. The council assigned Orin, Thor, and Loki to the task.

To prepare for the battle, Odin agreed to help train the party and troops on killing titans and fighting in general. Also he provided the party with a horn thst would summon the three Norse gods to the battlefield when the party required.

## Ithilid War
As the final battle was raging, and the party encountered Ceremorph-Zeus outside the Emperor's throne room, Spoops blew the horn to summon the Norse gods.

Odin and the others joined the fight. However even they had a great deal of trouble due to their inablility to target Zeus and Zeus' immunity to magic. Their avatars died multiple times throughout the fight. While their avatars may have been continuously dying, Spoops, and Breezy-E kept blowing the horn to being them back. 


## Campaign 2
Some time after Goopy blew up the bridge in Vrntia and thre himself back in time using magic from another universe, he found himself in this universe's astral plane. Loki is traveling through the Astral sea and happens to spot Goopy. Intrigued by his odd Plasmoid who's clearly not from this universe, and is radiating some sort of mysterious time magic, he disguises himself as the god Helm, and proceeds to chat with Goopy. They spend an immense and unknowable amount of time conversing and hanging out in the astral sea, concluding with Loki telling Goopy of Mardun and yrlling Goopy he must "Sharpen himself into a blade to defend the world" from some coming external threat. Goopy accepts this mission and Loki sends him back to Mardun.
