<h1>Gond</h1>
<p>Gond was a God of the forge who had his soul spilt into thousands of pieces. Long ago, when Spoops went by the name Myrkul and he hung out with Bane and Bhaal, Gond got on their bad side. Bane suggested they pull the ultimate prank on Gond and convinced Spoops and Baal to play along. They jumped Gond and Spoops split his soul into a thousands of pieces, scattering them through the universe. They laughed and strolled away, leaving him in this state for eons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>when the party went looking for Gond after Bazzdos found a fragment of him in the astral sea, Spoops realized what he did was not only seriously wrong, but Gond didnt reassemble, and he needed to atone by reassembling Gond.</p>
<h2>Fragments</h2>
<p>For each piece of his soul a gnome named Gond was put into the world.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the party began gathering the fragments, a few were permanently destroyed by Daurgothoth. This meant that even after fully reassembling all the pieces, there would still be a gap where the destroyed portion would be. To resolve this, Spoops and Bazzdos came up with the plan to attach the assembled Gond soul to Bazzdos’ own soul. Allowing Bazzdos and Gond to share the divine power and Gond’s consciousness to slowly heal as more pieces were added. Spoops partitioned their Souls so that while power would be shared, Gond and Bazzdos‘ consciousness would remain separate. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Searching Fywick</h2>
<p>The party went looking for Gond, assuming he had been reborn at some point as a Gnome named Gond. The party organized an event in Fywick where many &nbsp;gnomes named gond would be gathering. After inspection they found that no single gnome was the true Gond. Instead all of the gnomes named Gond had a fragment of Gond’s soul within their own. The party immediately concocted a plan. Spoops and Bazzdos would go to the dungeons of Morris Lux HQ and Adalynn and Breezy-e would gather and Gate the Gonds to them. Spoops and Bazzdos would perform Soul Surgery on each Gond, removing the divine portion of their soul and patching them up to the best of their ability. Spoops stitched this mass of Gond soulast together and implanted it as a partition within Bazzdos’ soul, empowering him and repairing Gond. The remaining Gonds were in a state of confusion, much of their memory was gone and they had very little sense of self. They were given instructions to go to Krorg’s Hometown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Krorg’s Hometown</h2>
<p>Upon arrival at Krorg’s Hometown, the citizens were confused by this massive horde of many gnomes named Gond, and trying to figure out what to do with them. At the same time, the party received intelligence that an Ithilid invasion was imminent at Krorg’s Hometown. They quickly responded by heading to the city themselves along with four warships. The Ithillids seemed to also be interested in these fragments of Gond. After an intense battle and swift victory. The party helped Krorg’s hometown to rebuild, explained the situation with the Gonds and committed Mortis Lux resources to the city to house and integrate these Gonds into their society.</p>
