## Zeus
![zeus.jpg](/zeus.jpg)
### Background
Chief among the olympians, and the most powerful god. He is incredibly egotistical and prideful. Such vices lead to him being swindled by the Prophet of Profit, and so he directed his anger towards a duel with Spoops, ending with him being exposed to the Far Realms. 
### Powers
Extremely high HP and AC, devastating lightning attacks, light speed travel. In his new form he wields terrifying Illithid powers. 
### Evil Deeds
- Tried killing Spoops in a duel
- Killed one of the bazz bros accidentally
- Joined forces with the Illithids
### Good Deeds
- Smited Achilles
### Fate After The Duel
Left the duel after seemingly dealing the killing blow to [Spoops](/spoops/overview). Ended up going to the Illithid flagship to kill the Prophet of Profit, but his witness to an outer god in his duel with Spoops left his mind vulnerable to Illithid entry, and was therefore corrupted. Now he's abandoned his body in favor of maximizing his new psychic powers. Now he guards the throne room of the Illithid Emperor.

### Ceremorph Zeus
During the final battle, the party engaged Zeus outside the Emperor's throne room. After finding that Zeus could not be targeted by attacks and was immune to magic, Spoops sought to weaken him by contacting the Council of gods and asking warning them of his plan. He then used the Pen of Jergal to Kill all worshippers of Zeus. Then he asked the Raven Queen to begin removing the memories of Zeus from all living and dead, including the Gods. The Council of Gods sat in stunned silence as they realized what Spoops had done. He had just begun the slow agonizing process of "executing" a God. This would slowly begin to drain Zeus's divine power and cause him to fade.

Spoops then realised this "Execution" would not be enough to stop him during the fight. Spoops grabbed the laser and positioned himself opposite Bazzdos with Zeus between them. He then fired his laser, targetting Bazzdos. Zeus who happened to be between them was grazed and injured by this powerful beam of non-magical damage! Then Bazzdos who was riding his Mechatarasque used its Armor plating to deflect the laser back at Spoops who did the same with his Mirror Shield. This "laser ping pong" struck Zeus eith every pass, doing immense damage each time. Eventually Zeus succumbed to his wounds and his divine soul was freed. Zeus thanked Spoops for freeing him before returning home, Spoops flipped that bitch off.

Zeus would then begin to fade in power and die as all worship and memories of him faded from existence.
