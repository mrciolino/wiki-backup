## Zeus
![zeus.jpg](/characters/other/zeus.jpg)
### Background
Chief among the olympians, and the most powerful god. He is incredibly egotistical and prideful. Such vices lead to him being swindled by the Prophet of Profit, and so he directed his anger towards a duel with Spoops, ending with him being exposed to the Far Realms. 
### Powers
Extremely high HP and AC, devastating lightning attacks, light speed travel. In his new form he wields terrifying Illithid powers. 
### Evil Deeds
- Tried killing Spoops in a duel
- Killed one of the bazz bros accidentally
- Joined forces with the Illithids
### Good Deeds
- Smited Achilles
### Fate
Left the duel after seemingly dealing the killing blow to [Spoops](/spoops/overview). Ended up going to the Illithid flagship to kill the Prophet of Profit, but his witness to an outer god in his duel with Spoops left his mind vulnerable to Illithid entry, and was therefore corrupted. Now he's abandoned his body in favor of maximizing his new psychic powers. Now he guards the throne room of the Illithid Emperor.
