<p>Battle ensued in the tavern as a demon rampaged through pope's pub but our "Gallant" and "Trustworthy" and "Heroic" "Heroes" "Killed" the demon and then "Peacefully" left following Freedom a magical escaped robot slave hell bent on freeing all the other enslaved robots and after failing his revolution to get the guards help he then paid our "Heroes" to clear the valuable mines of Fort Suro.</p>
<p>At the same time however Otto Herzog had a "faked" "bounty" on Os Vrntica and nearly Killed him and he would have died if not for Freedom</p>
<p>During the Demon Battle in the pub Spoops "seduced" and "gained" the "love" and "affection" of a powerful demon and "sent" him back to the abyss, all without learning his name</p>
<p>Drakham and Seriphi questioned the demon if he was their father, they gained no evidence from him he was either of their father and so their search continues</p>
<p>Frederina lost a dagger and forgot to go back to get it at the pub</p>
<p>Peter's charcater's name proved himself to be a shit thief and "almost" a "traitor" to team by healing the demon, after that "anyway so I started blasting" and the demon was "finished" by Spoops, though he did gain a lot of booze</p>
<p>Os Vrntica "apparently" has a "bounty" placed on his head and ultimately doesn't know if he is safe with Otto</p>
<p>Kiwi "YOUR NOT MY DAD"</p>
<p>Brazzart got his ass kicked by the guards then was saved by freedom may he live long and do something of importance</p>
<p>Will anyone remember that they were called to the pub for an unknown reason by an unknown coordinator or will they follow Freedom on a revolution for freedom?</p>
<p>Who knows next time on Low Bar Brawlers. The bar get lowered.</p>

<p>Our heroes woke up rested in the basement of the Fort Suro guard barracks, but drakham was chained up as the guards were convinced he summoned the demon in pope's pub. Our heroes went up to confont the captain of the guards and then instantly tried to steal and beg him for money and equipment after getting 3.50 and three daggers they pissed off the captain and left shortly afterwards. they explored fort suro but after that quick look around they went deep into the mines and are fighting for their lives surrounded and besieged by a whole den full of goblins and their wolves. Will they survive? Will they help Freedom? Why is Gilthur starting to hulk out? These questions answered next time in Low Bar Brawlers!</p>
