# Origin
Spoops is an ancient Primordial entity who first awoke in timeless time within his Divine Realm the Well of Souls. He is the God of Souls although he often equates that to being the god of life and death. Throughout his existence he has been known by many names and titles, including Myrkul God of Death, Avatar of Ry-ann, Grandmaster Paladin, His Holiness, The Crusader, and others. During the Ithilid War he has taken physical form as Spoops, one of the original Low Bar Brawlers, and a founding member Mortis Lux.

# Time of Troubles
For a time Spoops was known as Myrkul and adventured with Bane and Bhaal before their ascention to Godhood. During this period of time, Spoops and his allies were responsible for the events which led to the Time of Troubles. At the end of these events, Spoops's Avatar was destroyed by Cyric who seized much of his domain of Death. Then Spoops was suddenly confronted by AO who without a word, threw Spoops into the sea of a world in the mortal realm. However, while Spoops was indeed thrown down to the mortal realm, his inseperable connection to the Well of Souls remained. This resulted in the Splitting of his essence into two entities: Ry-ann the God who retained domain over Souls and Godly knowledge, and Spoops the Skeleton whos memories were replaced by knowledge of the very thing AO cast him into, water.


# Glubglub The Immortal's Invasion
After losing his memories and washing ashore in an unfamiliar land, Spoops lived and trained as a Paladin in an ancient city of High Elves. While wielding his trusty blade "The Cleanser", he drove back an invasion by the Crab God Glubglub by sealing their minion Jormungandr in a giant crystal in the city's castle. Unfortunately the city was sunk beneath the waves. As he is swept away, Spoop's memory becomes hazy again and he disappears from the world.



# Lich Wars
Spoops found himself washed ashore in a new world engulfed in war. As a group of Liches waged war on the world, Spoops found himself on the side of the living. After washing ashore, despite being a skeleton in a time when the undead were of particular concern, Spoops used his quick wit and determination to befriend the local community. However after his new home was demolished by the command of the Liches, he swore vengeance and departed with a surviving cleric to join up with the Paladins in the nearest city. Over many years, Spoops worked his way up to the level of Grandmaster Paladin. Commanding the forces of a legion of paladins, they departed in their ships accross the sea to meet their enemies in battle. However a rogue cell of paladins existed within the order who sought Spoops' downfall. During their voyage, they saw their opportunity to strike as Spoops contemplated the movements of the waves. With a deft hand they struck Spoops down, leaving him murdered and sinking into the depths of the sea.
