# Spoops
Spoops is an ancient Primordial entity who first awoke in timeless time within his Divine Realm the Well of Souls. He is the God of Souls although he often equates that to being the god of life and death. Throughout his existence he has been known by many names and titles, including Myrkul God of Death, Avatar of Ry-ann, Grandmaster Paladin, His Holiness, The Crusader, and others. During the Ithilid War he has taken physical form as Spoops, one of the original Low Bar Brawlers, and a founding member Mortis Lux.
