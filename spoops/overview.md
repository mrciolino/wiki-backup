# Origin
Spoops is an ancient Primordial entity who first awoke in timeless time within his Divine Realm the Well of Souls. He is the God of Souls although he often equates that to being the god of life and death. Throughout his existence he has been known by many names and titles, including Myrkul God of Death, Avatar of Ry-ann, Grandmaster Paladin, His Holiness, The Crusader, and others. During the Ithilid War he has taken physical form as Spoops, one of the original Low Bar Brawlers, and a founding member Mortis Lux.

# Time of Troubles
For a time Spoops was known as Myrkul and adventured with Bane and Bhaal before their ascention to Godhood. During this period of time, Spoops and his allies were responsible for the events which led to the Time of Troubles. At the end of these events, Spoops's Avatar was destroyed by Cyric who seized much of his domain of Death. Then Spoops was suddenly confronted by AO who without a word, threw Spoops into the sea of a world in the mortal realm. However, while Spoops was indeed thrown down to the mortal realm, his inseperable connection to the Well of Souls remained. This resulted in the Splitting of his essence into two entities: Ry-ann the God who retained domain over Souls and Godly knowledge, and Spoops the Skeleton whos memories were replaced by knowledge of the very thing AO cast him into, water.


# Glubglub The Immortal's Invasion
After losing his memories and washing ashore in an unfamiliar land, Spoops lived and trained as a Paladin in an ancient city of High Elves. While wielding his trusty blade "The Cleanser", he drove back an invasion by the Crab God Glubglub by sealing their minion Jormungandr in a giant crystal in the city's castle. Unfortunately the city was sunk beneath the waves. As he is swept away, Spoop's memory becomes hazy again and he disappears from the world.
