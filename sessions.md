## Session 1
###### January 8, 2020

Battle ensued in the tavern as a demon rampaged through pope's pub but our "Gallant" and "Trustworthy" and "Heroic" "Heroes" "Killed" the demon and then "Peacefully" left following Freedom a magical escaped robot slave hell bent on freeing all the other enslaved robots and after failing his revolution to get the guards help he then paid our "Heroes" to clear the valuable mines of Fort Suro.

At the same time however Otto Herzog had a "faked" "bounty" on Os Vrntica and nearly Killed him and he would have died if not for Freedom

During the Demon Battle in the pub Spoops "seduced" and "gained" the "love" and "affection" of a powerful demon and "sent" him back to the abyss, all without learning his name

Drakham and Seriphi questioned the demon if he was their father, they gained no evidence from him he was either of their father and so their search continues

Frederina lost a dagger and forgot to go back to get it at the pub

Peter's character's name proved himself to be a shit thief and "almost" a "traitor" to team by healing the demon, after that "anyway so I started blasting" and the demon was "finished" by Spoops, though he did gain a lot of booze

Os Vrntica "apparently" has a "bounty" placed on his head and ultimately doesn't know if he is safe with Otto

Kiwi "YOUR NOT MY DAD"

Brazzart got his ass kicked by the guards then was saved by freedom may he live long and do something of importance

Will anyone remember that they were called to the pub for an unknown reason by an unknown coordinator or will they follow Freedom on a revolution for freedom?

Who knows next time on Low Bar Brawlers. The bar get lowered.

## Session 2
###### January 15, 2020

Our heroes woke up rested in the basement of the Fort Suro guard barracks, but drakham was chained up as the guards were convinced he summoned the demon in pope's pub. Our heroes went up to confront the captain of the guards and then instantly tried to steal and beg him for money and equipment after getting 3.50 and three daggers they pissed off the captain and left shortly afterwards. they explored fort suro but after that quick look around they went deep into the mines and are fighting for their lives surrounded and besieged by a whole den full of goblins and their wolves. Will they survive? Will they help Freedom? Why is Gilthur starting to hulk out? These questions answered next time in Low Bar Brawlers!

## Session 3 - WTF
###### January 22, 2020

I dispensing with the story

the battle continued goblins died one was captured and investigated

bear was found guarding treasure and was suplexed into a treasure chest to contain it

goblin boss came with a badger and a cannon and killed Os Vrntica

But like the fucking gambler he is Drakham used his tides of chaos to get himself back up from death and fucked with the winds of magic and reincarnated Os Vrntica back into a high elf.

look its 1153 and I just can't even with the bad luck of 3 consecutive ones which lead to 2 people dying and then 3 consecutive crit 20s to bring everyone back to life.

## Session 4 - Guardison
###### January 29, 2020

So with the goblins defeated and their spoils looted the party collects their rewards from captain guardison in the fort suro barracks and after narrowly deciding against violence our brave few go and join a caravan as an escort. But before they take off in the morning they sleep in pope's pub for free and Otto is disturbed out of his sleep by

and after waking a couple other people the party talk with the ghostly pickle and gain from it a clue of spoops past and that the truth of the matter lies with Guardison SR in Trelston.

After that in the morning they move out with the caravan and run into highwaymen and instead of fighting them, our heroic party try to pay the toll by entertaining the Balk and his crew of ne'er-do-wells. Not only do they succeed, but Otto and Drakham steal 250 Gold and 5 Grenades, and Balk enjoys the performance so much that he gives a standing ovation and allows our team and the caravan to go unmolested.

Thus bringing all of them to Trelston a smaller coastal town where Guardison SR lives with the rest of the Guardison family and the first stop on the caravan route next stop Kaltrosar bay.

Bazzert, Drakham, and Frederina happen upon very hostile bridges but weather their assault and get to the lighthouse and happen to meet Guardison SR and then start leading him to Spoops and the rest of the party.

But right before Guardison can meet the team Drakham's uncontrollable powers of the magic weave have acted strangely and now his magic is cursed.

NEXT TIME WILL DRAKHAM'S MAGIC CAUSE CHAOS AND MISERY, WILL GUARDISON GIVE SPOOPS THE ANSWERS HE'S LOOKING FOR, WILL SERIPHI EVER BECOME INVOLVED WITH THE STORY AND COMBAT AGAIN?

ALL OF THIS ANSWERED NEXT TIME ON...

LOW BAR BRAWLERS
