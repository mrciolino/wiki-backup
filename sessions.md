## Session 1
###### January 8, 2020

Battle ensued in the tavern as a demon rampaged through pope's pub but our "Gallant" and "Trustworthy" and "Heroic" "Heroes" "Killed" the demon and then "Peacefully" left following Freedom a magical escaped robot slave hell bent on freeing all the other enslaved robots and after failing his revolution to get the guards help he then paid our "Heroes" to clear the valuable mines of Fort Suro.

At the same time however Otto Herzog had a "faked" "bounty" on Os Vrntica and nearly Killed him and he would have died if not for Freedom

During the Demon Battle in the pub Spoops "seduced" and "gained" the "love" and "affection" of a powerful demon and "sent" him back to the abyss, all without learning his name

Drakham and Seriphi questioned the demon if he was their father, they gained no evidence from him he was either of their father and so their search continues

Frederina lost a dagger and forgot to go back to get it at the pub

Peter's character's name proved himself to be a shit thief and "almost" a "traitor" to team by healing the demon, after that "anyway so I started blasting" and the demon was "finished" by Spoops, though he did gain a lot of booze

Os Vrntica "apparently" has a "bounty" placed on his head and ultimately doesn't know if he is safe with Otto

Kiwi "YOUR NOT MY DAD"

Brazzart got his ass kicked by the guards then was saved by freedom may he live long and do something of importance

Will anyone remember that they were called to the pub for an unknown reason by an unknown coordinator or will they follow Freedom on a revolution for freedom?

Who knows next time on Low Bar Brawlers. The bar get lowered.

## Session 2
###### January 15, 2020

Our heroes woke up rested in the basement of the Fort Suro guard barracks, but drakham was chained up as the guards were convinced he summoned the demon in pope's pub. Our heroes went up to confront the captain of the guards and then instantly tried to steal and beg him for money and equipment after getting 3.50 and three daggers they pissed off the captain and left shortly afterwards. they explored fort suro but after that quick look around they went deep into the mines and are fighting for their lives surrounded and besieged by a whole den full of goblins and their wolves. Will they survive? Will they help Freedom? Why is Gilthur starting to hulk out? These questions answered next time in Low Bar Brawlers!

## Session 3 - WTF
###### January 22, 2020

I dispensing with the story

the battle continued goblins died one was captured and investigated

bear was found guarding treasure and was suplexed into a treasure chest to contain it

goblin boss came with a badger and a cannon and killed Os Vrntica

But like the fucking gambler he is Drakham used his tides of chaos to get himself back up from death and fucked with the winds of magic and reincarnated Os Vrntica back into a high elf.

look its 1153 and I just can't even with the bad luck of 3 consecutive ones which lead to 2 people dying and then 3 consecutive crit 20s to bring everyone back to life.

## Session 4 - Guardison
###### January 29, 2020

So with the goblins defeated and their spoils looted the party collects their rewards from captain guardison in the fort suro barracks and after narrowly deciding against violence our brave few go and join a caravan as an escort. But before they take off in the morning they sleep in pope's pub for free and Otto is disturbed out of his sleep by

![Image of pickle]

and after waking a couple other people the party talk with the ghostly pickle and gain from it a clue of spoops past and that the truth of the matter lies with Guardison SR in Trelston.

After that in the morning they move out with the caravan and run into highwaymen and instead of fighting them, our heroic party try to pay the toll by entertaining the Balk and his crew of ne'er-do-wells. Not only do they succeed, but Otto and Drakham steal 250 Gold and 5 Grenades, and Balk enjoys the performance so much that he gives a standing ovation and allows our team and the caravan to go unmolested.

Thus bringing all of them to Trelston a smaller coastal town where Guardison SR lives with the rest of the Guardison family and the first stop on the caravan route next stop Kaltrosar bay.

Bazzert, Drakham, and Frederina happen upon very hostile bridges but weather their assault and get to the lighthouse and happen to meet Guardison SR and then start leading him to Spoops and the rest of the party.

But right before Guardison can meet the team Drakham's uncontrollable powers of the magic weave have acted strangely and now his magic is cursed.

NEXT TIME WILL DRAKHAM'S MAGIC CAUSE CHAOS AND MISERY, WILL GUARDISON GIVE SPOOPS THE ANSWERS HE'S LOOKING FOR, WILL SERIPHI EVER BECOME INVOLVED WITH THE STORY AND COMBAT AGAIN?

ALL OF THIS ANSWERED NEXT TIME ON...

Comments

WTF ever happened to Freedom and the robots slaves? Did we just fuck off because they weren't paying us?

## my god it went so WRONG
###### February 12 2020

First Krorg dressed up Bomb the bear to disguise him and get him in to human places

then the group heads to Kaltrosar Bay gets paid and looks for more work

goes to the castle looking for work doesn't work because Krorg brought a bear then they head to the merchant's guild get a job to clear out the sewers of Kaltrosar bay

All this while Bazzert transformed into a squirrel and infiltrated the castle

Drakham and Krorg get inside the castle with Otto, Frederina

Frederina gets arrested for touching the soft hands of the prince of kaltrosar

Bazzert screws up his disguise and get led to the dungeon

Krorg, Drakham, and Otto get a lieutenant of the guards to lead them to the sewer access in the castle's dungeon meeting up with bazzert and Fredderina

Drakham tries valiantly to unfuck the situation by persuading the guards there here to check the security of the castle and they failed by letting them in, they don't buy it.

The group gives in and is arrested then Drakham accidently kills lord Barrymoore in one hit

then more guards straight from the king of Kaltrosar, Bazzert angers the guards and They try to kill Bazzert so combat

After fighting through a large meaty man the group frees themselves, and freedom and get their stuff back and Freedom sets fire to the castle and as the group escapes they gather Os, Seiphiri, Spoops, and Kiwi and escape.

they escaped by distracting dock workers with free beer and by freeedom setting fire to the dock and everyone stowed away in cargo crates and got on a ship leaving Kaltrosar Bay

What will happen next time because I don't fucking even know and I'm the DM

Comments

You forgot the impending bear war because the king hates bears. 

## Boats and Hoes
###### February 19 2020

You all woke up on a trading ship

Started a bidding war with the captain for voyage on his ship and tried to kill him but at the same time the ship is attacked by Orcish pirates

You all team up to fight the pirates and Os Vrntica woke up Freedom and freedom came up and finished off the pirates on the boat

As the ship crew fights off the pirate ship Krorg fights Freedom with bomb the bear and with a Cannon he hit freedom and punched a hole through the ship.

Drakham and Os tried to stop the fighting but failed

After some fighting a Dragon Turtle shows up and attacks the trading ship and the pirate ships

Freedom then jumped on to the dragon turtle and Krorg followed and they drove the dragon turtle into the pirate fleet wrecking them

The rest of the gang now heads off to Alford with the Captain and his ship

Comments

All of pirates are dead and the fighting is over. After witnessing (and accidentally causing) Freedom's genocidal behavior in Kaltrosar Bay, fearing Freedom would attract the attention of vengeful armies, and being a general Luddite, Krorg decides to use the opportunity to eliminate Freedom. Os and Drakham both try to stop the fighting, but Krorg is set in his belief that Freedom is a dangerous weapon that the Low Bar Brawlers have only begun to abuse. Os issues an order to Freedom not to kill anyone in the party and to destroy the remaining pirate ships. Seconds later, Krorg starts blasting.

The first shot knocks Freedom deep into the ship, before Drakham casts reduce on the size of the cannon. Hearing Freedom moving below, Krorg and Bomb decide to gain the high ground in the fight by climbing the ship's mast. Drakham successfully charms Krorg to climb back down to the deck. Krorg agrees to surrender, but his sudden change in nature causes him to be bitten by Bomb, ending the spell. Off the side of the ship, Freedom appears while riding a large dragon turtle, about to head off to destroy the remaining pirate ships. Krorg thanks Bomb for saving him, and decides to leave Bomb behind to the safety of the Low Bar Brawlers. Then Krorg runs and dives off of the mast into the water, catching the dragon turtle's tail before being dragged off into the horizon...

## Hello Allford
###### February 26 2020

We get back after the pirate fight and after Freedom and Krorg jump on to a dragon turtle

The ship is still hectic and the crew and som eof the gang help out by repairing what they can and fishing up some fish for more food on the voyage to Allford

After some "hole" fixing shenanigans Os confronts the Elven task master of the ship and in fat its his cousin Eugene Vrntica though only noticing this after a short musical battle between the two

Then after a three day voyage the gang gets o Allford and immediately get referred to The West Sorea Trading Company for more work from Captain John Robin of the Seabird, but as immediately as that Otto and Frederina were pickpocketed and they were out to get their money back

After Kiwi read some thieves cant and they saw the thief head to the park and down a cave entrance then Bazzert almost set the park on fire as he produce flames while inside a bush

The gang of course put out the fire by Urinating on a bear rug and throughing it upon the burning bush

Drakham is first however in finding the thief and sneaks up on him and scares the pickpocket the corrupt guards in the thief tunnel and get the guards to point them in the direction of the thief

Down the sewer they went and through it all they all got covered in excrement and Bazzert almost killed himself and Drakham with more fire in a clod of methane above a pool of poop

After everyone getting covered in crap they found a small entrance staircase leading down and found themselves in tight corridors fighting spiders and zombies in trap filled hallways

What is next for our "Stalwart" adventurers more ASS? more GAS? more EXPLOSIONS?

Next time on Low Bar Brawlers!

## Session 9 Dungeon Trekking
###### March 4 2020

So we pick up right with Spoops exploring Allford and seems to piss off everyone and learns that the undead are hated because of a decades long conflict that ended 25 years ago called the necrotic wars and that to this day people hate the undead

All of this as Drakham and Bazzert are cornered by a pack of Spiders and Drakham justs annihilates them with his magical abilities

Then the party finds the lost halfing pickpocket and drag him along through halways of trap filled, skeeton filled danger

Os Vrntica follows up this excitement with a calming ballad which reinvigorate the party and prepares them for the rest of the dungeon, the likes of which are filled with a gelatinous cude, more spiders, and a Wall of Fire

The gang found a mysterious wall of fire and weird paintings that light up with proper activation, but before figuring out the mystery they have to deal with a mimic.

And then BOOM in from the outside and out of nowhere Krorg re-enters the fray and with a pirate crew with one goal to kill Freedom

After some introductions and re-introductions Krorg's crew dispel the wall of fire and are ready to move on to the dungeon exit.

Whats up next more spiders, Freedom, Kung Pow Chicken with a side of rice?

Who knows, Next Time on Low Bar Brawlers

## Shitty Pirate Revelations
###### March 11 2020

We pick back up in the Sewers where Krorg has just reunited with the party, and has a pirate crew accompanying him. This pirate crew came together after the pirate boarding at sea gone wrong as Krorg ended up marooned on shore with Nathar and looking to kill Freedom. They met with the Pirate King and added Dave Bones, Darfallen, and Xialethia to the Freedom kill team. The followed Freedom and found his clues pointing to Illiard Tower in Allford. They burst into the city sewers to enter the tower at its weakest point to avoid the defenses Freedom would put up, little did they know the defenses they were avoiding didn't exist and they were heading for a trap. Luckily they ran into the rest of the party who happened to be in the same sewer system. after reuniting Krorg had his new crew dispel the firewall the group moves forward and searches the next room only to find gibbets filled with corpses.

Spoops checks out the near by bedroom while Bazzert goes back to search some unexplored rooms and finds more cob webs and spider egg clutches, but leaves as he hears ominous scuttling noises. Soon after the pickpocket that was confonted in the sewers was torn to shreds by some unknown creature and the group left him to his fate.

After some searching Spoops and Bazzert find a book and unlock the ability to unlock and lock a certain door. Krorg blocks the path behind the party while Spoops opens up to see a woman surrounded by Four Skeletal Ogres she unleashes the Ogres and a Storm of fireballs at the party but with luck and perseverance the party weathers the storm and defeats the evil necrotic wizard.

This was only the prelude as soon things will go off the rails. The party navigates some very dangerous fireball traps and another pool of ****, only to find themselves at the bottom of deep 35ft pit and with some random trash being dropped on them.

After confronting the trash dropper and finding it to be Lucidel Illiard (Remember him kids he'll be important) Owner of Illiard Tower and and a Merchant lord of Allford. After helping our party out of the hole he introduces himself and tells our would be heroes that Freedom is in the other room. Freedom arrives after being called seeming to be beat up and a bit waterlogged. Either way though he is confronted by Dave Bones and the other pirates plus Krorg, Dave pulls out an ancient magic jar, The Hendrica Capsule, and sucks the soul out of Freedom everyone looked on as Red ominous demonic tendrils lash from the robotic frame to the insides of the jar and be sealed by Dave Bones. Freedom's body goes Limp and falls to the floor.

With their business done the pirates start to leave but Nathar confronts the rest and says that he is there to kill freedom for destroying his ships at sea, Dave Bones replies with "If ya here for death then I'll give it to ya!" and Shanks Nathar in the neck and Nathar falls bleeding and Dying instantly.

After such an unexpected and grizzly scene Bazzert asks Illiard if he can read him a book and Spoops asks for help trying to get a giant spider to hatch from a spider egg so it can be his pet.

Utter Psychotic levels of emotional awareness being showed only forced Illiard to notice the Glow from Spoops pants (No this is not getting sexual). Illiard asks Spoops if he has any magic items in his pocket Spoops reveals the demonic stone that he got from his Demon Boytoy from the Fort Suro Bar. Illiard then reveals the stones true nature a soul prison, and he releases the soul within it which flows back into Freedoms body and from this rises Freedom. Illiard explains that when the Demon was covered in Booze bleeding and dying that when Spoops killed him he actually had helped finish a demon ritual that trapped Freedom's soul in the stone Spoops has been holding all this time and putting the Demon into Freedom's body. Now with Freedom restored, the truth revealed, and the Party having met Illiard, he asks them if they've been to Fort Suro. They respond yes, and Illiard says that he has a job for them.

What will the pirates do with a Demon Soul?

Is Freedom fully restored?

What is the job Illiard offered?

Will Bazzert ever read his book?

Will Krorg avenge Nathar?

Who is Darmuth and why does Drakham know his name?

ALL OF THIS NEXT TIME IN LOW BAR BRAWLERS

[Image of Season 1 Poster]

## Leaving Allford
###### March 18 2020

So we return to our heroes after the Freedom soul switcher conundrum, and Krorg interrogates Os Vrntica about him being demonic/demon sympathizer. He does this by hiding his lute them holding him over a pit.

In the morning everyone awakes to find Illiard by some test tubes with bone spider carcasses on display and he gives the party a job to investigate and deal with a cult in the ghostwood forest near Demsford a small village. The party is told that they have a lot of authority in deciding how to deal with the cult as if they have an old necrotic war plague the cult could destroy Allford. That is all the info that Illiard knows about the cult situation and sets our heroes out to solve it.

Our heroes head out and search for Dave Bones and his team to see if they can stop them and avenge Nathar/get the demon soul. Our heroes fail as Krorg remembers where their escape boat would be docked but it was gone. However in their time searching Kiwi found a useful informant called Willey most likely a fence but to keep it simple: he knows a guy. After paying Willey the party learn more about the cult and they may be powerful sorcerers or brainwashed simpletons worshiping a WMD.

Then everyone goes shopping and the team gets a carriage drawn by two horses, this turns the party's travel time from a week down to 5 days. With one day left the party makes camp when entering the forest as nighttime travel through the ghostwood forest is dangerous and unadvised.

Everyone goes to sleep but Drakham loses control of his powers and he strikes himself and the horses with lighting bolt nearly killing himself and instantly killing the horses. Then Frederina is contacted by a large golden lobster that tells her to "join us" she ignores it and Krorg goes after it trying to catch it and eat it. Bazzert also goes after the lobster and turns into a slightly larger version of said lobster and starts fighting Krorg. Krorg accidentally hits the original golden lobster and he and bazzert are pulled through a portal and transported infront of some sort of ancient shadow creature it is unammused and banishes them from its sight. Krorg and Bazzert wake up in an underwater cave and hear the following "So, you have arrived." 


Who is this voice?

What was the creature in the portal?

Why lobsters?

Where did Spoops, Seiriphi, and Otto Herzog went?

All of this answered next time on

LOW BAR BRAWLERS!

## Session 11/12 Cults
###### March 26 2020

We come back to our heroes with Bazzert and Krorg in an underwater cave with Bazzert's master Ayod. He has come to tell his estranged student Bazeert that some stars are disappearing from the sky and he doesn't know why. Then Ayod helps train Bazzert to read the weird book.

Krorg resurfaces to see Frederina talking to golden lobster upon closer inspection see is entranced by it and doesn't notice Krorg. Os Vrntica and Krorg try to lift the lobster almost like a competition but they both fail completely to lift said golden lobster. After all that and having their horses be inconveniently dead, Bomb and Bazzert (transformed into a bear) pull the carriage to Demsford.

Four days prior we get back to Spoops in Allford strolling out of a bar an he hears the voice of the lord, his God. Spoops god says "Get your shit together and ride north". Sppops then robs a man passing by of his horse and leaves him on the street and rides north out of Allford. He rides for 4 days and gets to Demsford first and then immediately goes to the bar and drink.

The rest of the team shows up and on their way into the village they are greeted with desiccated corpses strung up on crosses, these were some of the villagers. The team then immediately sees an orphan boy and talk to him his name is Teddy  his parents were killed by the cult. Our heroes then go to the bar Spoops rejoins the group and they rally the villagers to kick the cult out of town. At the head of this mob every cultist our heroes find is cut down except for one as he will be used to lead the team to the cultist fortress.

After a couple hours trekking through the woods the come just outside the fortress and the team runs into a patrol and one of the patrol cultists run up into sight of the other cultists and then is turned into a pile of goo by Bazzert's acid arrow. Bazzert would repeat this trick on their guide cultist as ya know no loose ends and all that stuff. Now however loose ends ware not the focus as there is an entire fortress of cultists to fight. 

Krorg and bomb mount the battlements and start slaughtering the cultists, Os and Spoops charge the front gate while on horseback taking out a couple but sustaining major damage. Bazzert and Drakham doing a couple things like arguing and turning into gas but besides that not a whole lot. The battle quickly turns however as every cultist comes over to fight the would be defilers (the team), Krorg and Bob get pinned down by a crossbow and magic barrage and the rest of the team is following...
THE DRAKHAM PLAN
So the plan is to retreat and wait until the cultists aren't alert and then break in by making holes in their wall and kill them all group by group instead of a frontal assault against all of them at once.

Little does Drakham know the cult fortress already has holes in its walls and Krorg and Bomb would eventually die if left alone to fight all the cultists by themselves. So the instead follow...
THE SECOND DRAKHAM PLAN
So this plan is to ride around the side of the fortress and flank the cultists on horseback like a mini cavalry charge and saving Krorg and Bomb.

This plan while a bit better also failed as one of the cultist ran to get his boss. During the time before the cultist boss shows up Bazzert is attack by the fortress firing squad and gets struck by crossbow bolts and fire bolts and falls unconscious in a burning tree, good thing Frederina stopped the flames from burning Bazzert alive and pulling him from the tree. But then...
VEERIAN RATHWING ARRIVES

(Dark souls boss fight music intensifies)

[Token image of Rathwing]


Bazzert now however is pulling a lot of weight and starts obliterating the cultists with lightning and moonbeams thinning out the firing squad targeting Krorg and Bomb. But Krorg and Bomb have bigger issues now as Veerian animates 5 gold coins from his pocket and sends them to attack Bomb. The coins brutalize Bomb and Bomb falls unconscious after a tiring fight being pin-cushioned by cultist crossbows, burned by firebolts and now he succumbs to the coins. Everyone now focuses on Rathwing as the cultists are all dead but for two and those to decide to run than die. In the ensuing battle Krorg throws his trident into the side of Rathwing and then pulls Rathwing from the air down over the fortress walls. The rest of the team closes in for the kill but Rathwing goes invisible and attacks the team from the shadows. A fireball strikes Spoops and Drakham causing Drakham to fall but Spoops gives chase toward the direction of the attack. Rathwing fails to blind Spoops and he casts detect good and evil now seeing Rathwing's evil aura.

But then...
Bomb the Bear Dies

[Image of tombstone reading RIP Bomb with token image of Bomb]

This happens unbeknownst to Krorg and so he breaks two of the five animated gold coins on his way to Drakham who is dying on the ground. Spoops continues to battle an invisible Rathwing and Bazzert attacks Rathwing with his Moonbeam but also Scorching Spoops with the holy moonfire causing spoops to fall unconcious. Krorg helps Drakham and Drakham pulls out some wild magic and absorbs the life force of the animated coins and some of Krorgs and rises from near death like a phoenix. Quickly after this though Rathwing disengages from the fight and says "You are all vermin who aren't worth my time and these peasants are useless, I've already got what I wanted. Au revoir" Rathwing disappears and moments later Krorg sees him flying away westward over the hills and trees.

Krorg now goes back to Bomb and discovers that bomb is dead he and Drakham are greatly saddened by this loss and move him to the rierside to bury him. Meanwhile Bazzert decides to try and decipher his book and is able to just read the first line in the the book...
HOW TO KILL GODS
What the fuck is this book?
Is Bomb really dead?
Where did Rathwing run off to hide?
Why are stars disappearing from the night sky?
SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS ANSWERED NEXT TIME IN...
LOW BAR BRAWLERS

## Session 13 Grief and shopping
###### March 29 2020

We return after the fight with the cultists and Bomb the bear is dead. Drakham and Spoops are arguing over what to do with Bomb as Krorg sleeps. They enter into a mexican standoff, Drakham clutching his last grande and Spoops with rope threatening to take Bomb's corpse. Eventually Krorg wakes up and decicdes to bury Bomb Spoops goes along as he was charmed by Drakham. Drakham used a patch from his cloak to excavate a 10 by 10 by 10ft hole to bury bomb and after some kind words the group bury bomb with the cultists. But there were too many cultists for the hole and so you guys burned the corpses and then finished the burial. After the funeral you return back to the mission at hand to search for artifacts and weapons belonging to the old Liches of the necrotic wars. Along they way you Bazzert finds a coo, looking gem and gathers a bunch of random ingredients that aren't that suspicious for a druid to gather but did so in a suspicious manner and has up to this point the morning after the session hasn't yet told me the DM what he plans to do with it so I'll keep my eye on him.

Our heroes however find excavated areas in the fortress and with that a chest contaminated with a green glowing liquid, all the vials are broken except one half filled vial. Drakham and Spoops then conduct some "experiments" on the liquid combining it with holy water, spit, seeing if it flammable, and taking contaminated dirt and dumping it into a freshly made grave. the green liquid sizzles away from the holy water, just combines with spit, is very flammable, and we''ll get back to the grave "experiment" later.

The team search a tower on the east side of the ruined fortress and find a pentagram symbol and a flayed body stabbed with a demonic dagger. Spoops decides to be cautious and throw a dagger into the body in the pentagram. Then Krorg takes the arcane focuses he got from the cultist wizards and places them at the points in the pentagram star, this causes the body to float and start screaming. the team tries to disguise themselves as cultists, no effect, try to break the ritual, not effective, Bazzert uses the cursed horn and the screaming corpse starts play demonic music. After a while the team pulls out the daggers from the corpses chest and it speaks to them. He is the protector of the poisons in the fortress and tells the team what he can. Then after trying to free his soul or at least learn how the team just break the pentagram ritual and start to leave the fortress. As the cross the bridge over the river they are attacked by a giant bone spider coming from their freshly dug grave. In the battle Drakham and Krorg nearly die but Bazzert and Spoops defeat the abomination. Then they depart to return to Demsford.

The team returns to Demsford at night and find it abandoned with no signs of people or life Then the team remembers Teddy and starts to look for him, but alas can't find anyone in the town, so they head up to the cultist temple on the hill and find alot of corpses strung up on crosses and half mutated with disgusting bone appendages sticking out of them and twitching but no sign of Teddy. Everyone heads back to the inn and starts to pack up and leave as Spoops contaceted his God Ryan and said its time to leave. As the rest of the team prep the horse and carriage Krorg goes back up to the temple and take one last look for Teddy and find the Temple barred from the inside and decides to just leave. Our hereos leave Demsford and head back to Allford.

Back in Allford they go to see Illiard and then get informed by his secretary that Illiard is meeting with the king, so they steal a document with an Illiard seal on it and bluff their way into the castle. Our heroes are seated in a minor dinning room in the castle and wait for Illiard to show up. During the 5 hours that they wait Krorg and Spoops find a small girl playing under the stairs and play with her while they wait for Illiard. Illaird shows up and to keep this short the team doesn't trust Illiard try to discern his intentions, Spoops casts Zone of Truth and get him to say he just wants the Old Lich weapons/poisons so he can research them and be able to protect himself and Allford in case they are attacked by such things in the future. The team has a green liquid vial but don't tell Illiard about it. 

Then everyone goes shopping until 1am and I start to breakdown a little as my mental faculties are assaulted by ineptitude, ignorance, and constant and unceasing haggling attempts. Krorg got a bad ass cape, Spoops got plate armor, Drakham spent a lot of money agreed to an unscrupulous deal for a discount on armor, and Bazzert... Bazzert keeps treating every cool little nick-nack he finds like crafting items in Minecraft to try and make a bunch of magic staffs even though he already has one and just doesn't use it/doesn't make an attempt to use it.

Oh yeah I forgot to mention the Illiard job with Beholder in the king's vault, don't worry we'll be going over that in class on Wednesday so until next time you fucking Low Bar Brawlers.
