## **The Five Dragonborn Clans**  

### **Overview**  
The five major dragonborn clans originated in **Kaltrazar Bay** but were forced to migrate south to the **Gothrian region (modern-day Rintica)** after the kings of Kaltrazar allied with devils, legalized slavery, and imposed tyranny.  

### **Clan Distribution**  
1. **Clan Norixius** ("Gold" Dragonborn)  
   - **Base:** Inferno’s Rest (Dragon Temple)  
   - **Traits:** Militaristic, wealthy, deceptive (claim gold heritage despite being brass).  
   - **Current Leader:** Xyrax (aggressive, young).  
   - **Notable Conflict:** Subjugated Clan Cai Pao (999 AD).  

2. **Clan Cai Pao**  
   - **Base:** Inferno’s Rest (Dragon Temple)  
   - **Traits:** Skilled weapon-smiths, high-quality craftsmanship.  
   - **Status:** Recently weakened by Norixius assassinations and asset seizures.  

3. **Three Clans in Tiamat’s Rest** *(Names undisclosed in transcript)*  
   - **Base:** Tiamat’s Rest (western side of Kaltrazar Bay’s former territory).  
   - **Traits:** More traditional, resistant to Rintican royal influence due to tensions with dragons.  
   - **Conflict:** Distrust Rintica’s dragon-allied monarchy.  

### **Historical Context**  
- **Exile from Kaltrazar Bay (483 AD):**  
  - Dragonborn fled enslavement under devil-backed Kaltrazar rulers.  
  - **Chapel of Victory Incident:** Kaltrazar forces ambushed the fleeing clans, but Os Rintica’s knights crushed them, securing the clans' loyalty.  
- **Current Power Dynamics:**  
  - **Norixius** is now the largest and richest clan.  
  - **Cai Pao** is the smallest but was once the wealthiest (due to weapon trade).  
  - The **Tiamat’s Rest clans** resist full integration with Rintica.  

### **Economic & Military Influence**  
- **Norixius & Cai Pao:** Major arms dealers (halberds, crossbows, medium armor).  
- **Norixius Expansion:** Seeking **dragon-forged weapons** using Inferno’s Rest resources.  
- **Tiamat’s Rest Clans:** Less economically dominant, more insular.
