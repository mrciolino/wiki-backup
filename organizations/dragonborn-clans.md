## **The Five Dragonborn Clans**  
Dragonborns are an ancient race on Mardun, believed to have come about during the Age of Dragons, and possibly even earlier. During the Age of Ascension, Dragonborn populations are mainly focused in **Kaltrosar** and later **Vrintia** and **Tiamar's Bazzar**. Given their clanlike loyalties, 5 major dragonborn clans began to emerge: Norixius, Caipao, X, Y, and Z. These clans lived in **Kaltrosar** but were forced to flee south towards **Vrintia** after the kings of Kaltrazar allied with devils, legalized slavery, and imposed tyranny. Unable to fully assimilate into Vrintia, three of the 5 clans went westward and founded a trading port known as **Tiamar's Bazzar**. The two remaining clans, feeling kinship towards **Inferno**, the ancient red dragon allied with Os, decided to take up residence in the Osian Vale and build the Dragon Temple there. Tensions between these two group would flare up after Arn's Rebellion, where Tiamar's Bazzar surrendered to the rebels and supplied weapons against Vrintia.

2. **Clan Caipao**  
   - **Base:** Inferno’s Rest (Dragon Temple)  
   - **Traits:** Skilled weapon-smiths, high-quality craftsmanship.  
   - **Status:** Recently weakened by Norixius assassinations and asset seizures.  

3. **Clan X** 
   - **Base:** Tiamar’s Bazzar.
