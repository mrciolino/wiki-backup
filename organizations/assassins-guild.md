# Assassins Guild

The Assassins Guild is a feared and enigmatic organization operating from the Library Dimension, a realm where all written knowledge is eventually collected, and time flows inconsistently. The guild resides atop the Mountain of Assassination Notes, a vast pile of contracts spanning the multiverse, determining their targets from the ever-growing collection of assassination requests. Due to their interdimensional nature, no target is beyond their reach, and they ensure payment through a strict enforcement policy—failure to pay often results in the client becoming the next target.

## Structure and Operations

The guild is composed of various key roles:

- **Assassins:** A mix of mundane and magical killers, responsible for carrying out contracts.
- **Support Staff:** Maintains armor, weaponry, and ensures the assassins are well-fed.
- **Magical Specialists:** Handle interdimensional transport and communications.
- **Hangers-On:** A collection of wanderers, misfits, and the occasional scholar seeking refuge in the guild’s dangerous but stable environment.

### Payment Enforcement
If a client refuses to pay for an assassination, the guild follows a simple policy:
1. Attempt negotiation.
2. If negotiation fails, assassinate the defaulter.
3. If the target is too powerful to kill, the guild deems them unworthy of hiring assassins in the first place.

## Location

The Assassins Guild operates exclusively from the **Library Dimension**, specifically atop the Mountain of Assassination Notes. The guild members either live directly on the mountain or in makeshift caves created by shifting paper and books. This exclusive location ensures secrecy and security, preventing outside interference from disrupting their operations. However, the unpredictable time dilation of the Library Dimension has led to assassins being permanently lost to the flow of time, sometimes growing old and dying before they can return from a mission.

## Membership and Recruitment

The guild consists of a wide variety of individuals, including:
- Sociopathic wanderers drawn by the thrill of the hunt.
- Individuals escaping divine wrath or interdimensional entrapment.
- Some members have even been freed from cursed books found within the Library Dimension.
- A few rare cases where assassins have started families within the guild.

### Membership Rules
- **No one leaves voluntarily.** Assassins either die on the job or within the guild.
- **Expulsion is non-existent.** If a member is deemed unworthy, they are eliminated.

## The Founding of the Guild

According to legend, the guild was founded thousands of years ago by **Stabbé, a changeling serial killer**. After being forcibly removed from his home dimension by high-level wizards, Stabbé wandered the multiverse until he discovered the Library Dimension. There, he took up paper mâché, angering the dimension’s inhabitants by destroying valuable books. Assassination contracts against him began accumulating on the Mountain of Assassination Notes, drawing assassins to kill him.

However, Stabbé proved too formidable, eliminating his would-be killers and instead brainwashing them into servitude. Over time, these captured assassins became the first generation of the guild. Realizing he could profit from the constant flow of assassination contracts, Stabbé transformed his captors into a professional organization, laying the groundwork for the interdimensional guild that exists today.

## Party Interactions

### First Encounter
The **Mors Lux adventuring party** encountered the guild when they stumbled upon a group of assassins playing chess on the Mountain of Assassination Notes. Upon learning about the guild’s operations, the party devised a plan to pay the assassins in advance for information regarding contracts taken out against them. This arrangement ensured that they were always forewarned of potential threats.

### Legal Representation
Later, the party sought legal representation from the guild’s lawyer, discovering that he was the **nephew of Asmodeus, the Lord of the Nine Hells**. This connection proved invaluable when the party needed to negotiate an accord with the gods after a small misunderstanding involving the destruction of an entire planet and mass owl bear genocide.
