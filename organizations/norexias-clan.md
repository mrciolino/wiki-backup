Clan Norixius is one of the five major dragonborn clans in the Kingdom of Rintica, renowned—and often ridiculed—for their insistence on being called "gold" dragonborn despite being predominantly brass dragonborn. They perpetuate this myth to elevate their status, claiming their lightning breath (a trait of blue dragonborn, not gold) makes them superior. This deception stems from deep-seated insecurities about their appearance and standing among other dragonborn.  

## **Insecurities and Fashion**  
The clan’s members are highly image-conscious, compensating for their perceived inadequacies with extravagant displays of wealth. They adorn themselves with silver jewelry and gemstones, preferring these over gold to contrast against their brassy scales. Their fashion emphasizes opulence—fine silks, intricately crafted armor, and vibrant clothing—all designed to project superiority.  

### **Key Points:**  
- **Appearance vs. Reality:**  
  - Most Norixius members are brass dragonborn but insist they are "gold" for prestige.  
  - Claim their lightning breath (a blue dragonborn trait) makes them "elite."  
- **Fashion as Power:**  
  - Prefer **silver and gemstones** over gold to stand out.  
  - Wear **fine silks, ornate armor, and vibrant colors** to assert dominance.  
- **Psychological Drivers:**  
  - Deep-seated **insecurity** about their place among dragonborn clans.  
  - **"Bucket of Crabs" mentality**—internal competition prevents any one member from rising too high without allies.

## **Hard vs. Soft Power**  
While Clan Norixius outwardly flaunts soft power (diplomacy, wealth, and influence), they heavily invest in hard power (military strength). They are the most militant of the dragonborn clans, maintaining a formidable fighting force despite their preference for appearing as refined elites.  

### **Power Dynamics:**  
| **Soft Power** | **Hard Power** |  
|---------------|---------------|  
| Diplomacy, trade, and alliances | Military strength, assassinations, asset seizures |  
| Lavish displays of wealth | Secretly fund mercenaries and weapon production |  
| Prefer political maneuvering | Will engage in open conflict if necessary |  

### **Leadership Structure:**  
- **Ruthless Competition:**  
  - Leaders rise through **strength or strategic alliances**.  
  - Betrayals are common, but retribution is severe (e.g., Dontera’s assassination).  
- **Current Leader (1000 AD):**  
  - **Xyrax (27 years old)**—aggressive, likely orchestrated Dontera’s death.  
  - **Past Leader:** **Dontera (60s)**—diplomatic, met a suspicious end ("fell onto 37 knives").

## **The Five Clans and Migration**  
Originally from **Kaltrazar Bay**, all five dragonborn clans migrated south to the Gothrian region (modern-day Rintica) after the kings of Kaltrazar allied with devils, instituting slavery and tyranny.  

### **Key Events:**  
- **Chapel of Victory Incident (483 AD):**  
  - Kaltrazar’s forces ambushed fleeing dragonborn near modern-day Rintica.  
  - **Os Rintica and his knights intervened**, crushing the slavers and securing the clans' loyalty.  
  - Marked the **last major military campaign led by Os himself**.  
- **Settlement:**  
  - **Norixius & Cai Pao** settled near **Inferno’s Rest** (Dragon Temple).  
  - **Other three clans** reside in **Tiamat’s Rest**.

## **Notable Members**  

### **Krivesh**  
- **Affiliation:** Adventurers' Guild.  
- **Immortality?** Has lived for centuries despite appearing mortal—possibly due to time magic or a hidden curse.  
- **Role:** Acts as an intermediary between the Guild’s leadership and external factions.  

### **Vruush (Deceased)**  
- **Legendary Warrior:** Left the clan to slay dragons and prove his worth.  
- **The Curse of Vruush:**  
  - Adventuring groups he abandoned often met gruesome fates.  
- **Destruction of Three Tips Gorge:**  
  - Lured **four dragons (2 red, 1 blue, 1 green)** into a trap using a merchant caravan as bait.

- **Founder:** **Norix (2000 BC - 0 BC)**—claimed to have led the dragonborn rebellion against draconic enslavers.

  - Now lost, with a **king’s ransom** offered for its return.

## **Morality and Conflicts**  
- **Alignment:** **Lawful Evil to Chaotic Neutral**—honor exists in a mafia-like sense (betrayals = death).  
- **Key Conflicts:**  
  - **Cai Pao (999 AD):** Assassinated leaders, seized wealth, now dominate them.  
  - **Afrididi Refugees:** Compete for influence in Dufurna’s Rest.  
  - **Kobolds:** Despise them but exploit their labor for mass weapon production.

- **Reproduction:**  
  - Dragonborn give **live birth** (no eggs).  
  - Hybrid offspring’s scale color depends on **lunar phases** (metallic vs. chromatic dominance).

## **Miscellaneous Notes**

  - **Yellow & Purple Dragons** have emerged, with royal purple dragons tied to Inferno’s Rest’s shogunate lineage.  
- **Giants:** An emerging threat (details unexplored).

### **Final Thoughts**  
Clan Norixius embodies **arrogance, ambition, and relentless dominance**—whether through gold-plated lies or bloodstained halberds. Their rise to power under Xyrax marks a new era of ruthlessness, ensuring their place as the richest and most feared dragonborn clan in Rintica.
