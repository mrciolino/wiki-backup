### **Clan Norixius (The "Gold" Dragonborn Clan)**  

Clan Norixius is one of the five major dragonborn clans in the Kingdom of Rintica, renowned—and often ridiculed—for their insistence on being called "gold" dragonborn despite being predominantly brass dragonborn. They perpetuate this myth to elevate their status, claiming their lightning breath (a trait of blue dragonborn, not gold) makes them superior. This deception stems from deep-seated insecurities about their appearance and standing among other dragonborn.  

#### **Insecurities and Fashion**  
The clan’s members are highly image-conscious, compensating for their perceived inadequacies with extravagant displays of wealth. They adorn themselves with silver jewelry and gemstones, preferring these over gold to contrast against their brassy scales. Their fashion emphasizes opulence—fine silks, intricately crafted armor, and vibrant clothing—all designed to project superiority.  

#### **Hard vs. Soft Power**  
While Clan Norixius outwardly flaunts soft power (diplomacy, wealth, and influence), they heavily invest in hard power (military strength). They are the most militant of the dragonborn clans, maintaining a formidable fighting force despite their preference for appearing as refined elites. Their leadership operates like a "bucket of crabs," where internal competition is fierce, and rising to the top requires either overwhelming strength or strategic alliances.  

### **The Five Clans and Migration**  
Originally from Kaltrazar Bay, all five dragonborn clans migrated south to the Gothrian region (modern-day Rintica) after the kings of Kaltrazar allied with devils, instituting slavery and tyranny. The Norixius and Cai Pao clans settled near **Inferno’s Rest** (the Dragon Temple), while the other three clans reside in **Tiamat’s Rest**.  

The exodus culminated in the **Chapel of Victory incident (483 AD)**, where Kaltrazar’s forces ambushed the fleeing dragonborn. Os Rintica and his knights intervened, crushing the slavers and securing the clans' loyalty to Rintica. This marked the last major military campaign led by Os himself.  

### **Leadership (Campaign 2 Era, 1000 AD)**  
- **Past Leader:** **Dontera**, a diplomatic and peaceful ruler in her 60s, met a suspicious end—allegedly "falling onto 37 knives."  
- **Current Leader:** **Xyrax**, a 27-year-old aggressive strategist who likely orchestrated Dontera’s assassination. Under him, the clan has grown more ruthless, seizing assets and assassinating rivals, particularly from Clan Cai Pao.  

#### **Interactions with the Party**  
The party has only encountered a minor Norixius advisor during an RVASS induction ceremony.  

### **Notable Members**  
- **Krivesh:** A seemingly immortal dragonborn affiliated with the Adventurers' Guild. Despite appearing mortal, he has lived for centuries, possibly due to time magic or a hidden curse.  
- **Vruush:** A legendary warrior who left the clan to prove himself by slaying dragons. His exploits include:  
  - **The Curse of Vruush:** Adventuring groups he left behind often met gruesome fates.  
  - **The Destruction of Three Tips Gorge:** In a week-long battle, Vruush lured four dragons (two red, one blue, one green) into a trap using a merchant caravan as bait. The clash destroyed the gorge, and though Vruush perished, his halberd—bearing the blood of three dragon types—became a revered clan relic.  

### **Founding and Rebellion**  
Founded by **Norix** between **2000 BC and 0 BC**, the clan claims he led the dragonborn rebellion against their draconic enslavers using the **Norixius Razor**, a dagger that steals shadows of its victims. The blade, now lost, remains a sought-after artifact with a king’s ransom offered for its return.  

### **Morality and Conflicts**  
- **Morality:** Ranges from **lawful evil to chaotic neutral**. They value honor in a mafia-like sense—betrayals are met with extreme retribution.  
- **Key Conflicts:**  
  - **Cai Pao (999 AD):** Norixius assassinated Cai Pao’s leaders and seized their wealth, becoming the dominant clan.  
  - **Afrididi Refugees:** Compete for influence in Dufurna’s Rest.  
  - **Kobolds:** Despise them but exploit their labor for mass weapon production.  

### **Power and Business**  
- **Low Point:** Exile from Kaltrazar Bay (483 AD).  
- **Current Status (1000 AD):** The largest and richest clan, thanks to weapon manufacturing (halberds, crossbows, medium armor) and recent Cai Pao acquisitions. They seek **dragon-forged weapons**, leveraging Inferno’s Rest’s resources.  
- **Reproduction:** Dragonborn give live birth (no eggs). Hybrid offspring’s scale color depends on lunar phases—metallic/chromatic dominance shifts accordingly.  

### **Miscellaneous Notes**  
- **Yellow & Purple Dragons:** New draconic types have emerged, including royal purple dragons tied to Inferno’s Rest’s shogunate lineage.  
- **Giants:** An emerging threat, though details remain unexplored.  

Clan Norixius embodies arrogance, ambition, and a relentless drive for dominance—whether through gold-plated lies or bloodstained halberds.
