**Purpose:**  
The law enforcement organization in [Vrintia](/locations/vrintia), dedicated to maintaining order and protecting the kingdom.

**Key Members:**  
- Jebidiah Guardinson: The head of the Royal Guard of Vrintia, and patriarch of the Guardinson family, a noble line of guards that stretch back 1000 years. He is the top law enforcer in all of Vrintia and posesses the rare ability to arrest Royals.
- [Sergeant Lemrick](/characters/sergeant-lemrick): A stern and no-nonsense leader of the guard. Tomas' former leader who decided to disbar Tomas from the force after hearing that he was going to pass on the opportunity to join RVA and squander his father Verran's sacrifice. However he still saw the soul oriented towards justice within Tomas and secretly deputized him with a Vrintian Guard Dagger as a symbol of authority. 
- [Clara](/characters/clara-the-cleric): A cleric serving the City Guard who helped heal the party after they were attacked at the Golden Bear Tavern.
- [Thomas Stonebrook](/characters/thomas-stonebrook): A former guard and current member of the party. Despite no longer serving in the city authority Tomas still carries out his duties and acts as an enforcer to the complicated rules of Vrintia. 
- Verran Stonebrook: Tomas' father who became a guard at RVA so that his son could get a better education and not have to become a guard. However it was revealed that Headmaster [Tadabar Soulfire](/characters/tadabar-soulfire) secretly enslaved Verran into servitude after Verran attempted to accuse a Royal of murdering his wife. So Verran was forced to guard the mainly unused back door of the archmage's tower for 15+ years.
- Barov Grimsley: A strong dwarven former city guard who was once championed as "Hero of the City" after stopping a robbery at the Bank of Os. Noted for his brute strength and use of brass knuckles. Unfortunately he quit the guard and ended up working for the Church of Crows, running a slave pit operation and brutalizing anyone who got in the way of their plans. Eventually he was caught by the party where he confessed his crimes of murder and treason, and cursed the royals with his dying breath before being executed. 

**Relationships with the Party:**  
- [Thomas Stonebrook](/characters/thomas-stonebrook) has a complicated relationship with the guard due to his removal from the organization.  
- [Sergeant Lemrick](/characters/sergeant-lemrick) respects the party’s potential but remains cautious.  

**Significant Actions or Events:**  
- **[Session 1](/session/session-1):** [Sergeant Lemrick](/characters/sergeant-lemrick) questioned the party about the events at the [Golden Bear Tavern](/locations/golden-bear-tavern).  
- **[Session 3](/session/session-3):** [Sergeant Lemrick](/characters/sergeant-lemrick) revealed that he removed [Thomas](/characters/thomas-stonebrook) from the guard for political reasons, not incompetence.
