<h1>Red Keep</h1>
<p>An assassination organization located in the region Dracofel deep in the Jade Forest. Founded by <a href="/characters/Bazvrah">Bazvrah</a>, when he was young, the Red Keep focused on using psychic magic with stealth and deception to carry out kills.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Member Counts</h2>
<p>The peak of the Red Keep came when Bazvrah found out about Bazzert's coma during the push into Allford to kill <a href="/characters/Darmuth">Darmuth</a>. In the 2 year time skip, Bazvrah consistently recruited assassins to form an army of 30 against Darmuth's forces. The Red Keep came to an end when Bazvrah took over as the Tree of Knowledge in the Library dimension.</p>
