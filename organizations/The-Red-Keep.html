<h1>Red Keep</h1>
<p>An assassination organization located in the region Dracofel deep in the Jade Forest. Founded by Bazzvrah, when he was young, the Red Keep focused on using psychic magic with stealth and deception to carry out kills.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Member Counts</h2>
<p>The peak of the Red Keep came when Bazzvrah found out about Bazzert's coma during the push into Allford to kill Darmuth. In the 2 year time skip, Bazzvrah consistently recruited assassins to form an army of 30 against Darmuth's forces. The Red Keep came to an end when Bazzvrah took over as the Tree of Knowledge in the Library dimension.</p>
