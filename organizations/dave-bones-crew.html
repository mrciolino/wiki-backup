<p>The Dave Bones pirate crew started at the Pirate Capital of Saragassa in the Dragon Sea. The pirate crew was apart of the Pirate Raid of Alford by led by Pirate King Krorg and the Low Bar Brawlers. The Floating Cask was the name of his ship, and served to be the final ship many pirates sailed on.</p>

<p>The crew is led by the infamous pirate named Dave Bones. Dave Bones was personally made a pirate captain by the Pirate King of Saragossa himself to do his dirtiest work. So Dave Bone was constantly cycling through members due to a very high mortality rate on his crew. After Krorg washed ashore Saragossa in his hunt for Freedom, the Pirate King became very interested in Freedom's demon soul and sent Dave Bones to capture it and use it to power the ultimate pirate battleship. Eventually the Dave Bones crew disbanded after Dave Bone's first death.</p>
