# **The Adventurers Guild**  

## **Overview**  
The Adventurers Guild is a secretive and immensely powerful organization composed of individuals who operate beyond the reach of ordinary mortal society. They inhabit a custom demiplane, stitched together from smaller pocket dimensions using high-level magic (including 9th-level spells and multiple conjoined 8th-level spells). Their true motives are unknown, but they function as puppet masters, employing adventurers as disposable agents in a hidden conflict that spans time and reality. The Guild maintains near-unlimited financial resources, allowing them to fund operations across multiple planes and timelines.

## **Structure & Operations**  
The Guild's base is an extradimensional stronghold, forged through the fusion of multiple demiplanesâ€”a feat only possible with magic of the highest order. Their leadership includes:
- **Kroveshneryxius**: A powerful dragonborn clan leader
- **The Time Wizard (Drothar?)**: A Pythagorean survivor who meticulously calculates every action based on temporal consequences
- Other unnamed but equally formidable members who appear more mortal in nature

Their methods involve infiltrating mortal cities through seemingly random tavern encounters, posing as wealthy patrons offering suspiciously vague contracts. These tasks (like delivering unmarked boxes to remote locations) are actually carefully orchestrated moves in their grand scheme. The Guild maintains a policy of strict deniability, using adventurers as cutouts to avoid direct involvement.



## **Origins & History**  
The Guild's roots trace back to the **Pythagorean Empire**, the first civilization to master true arcane magic after the Age of Dragons. The Time Wizard escaped the empire's cataclysmic fall, which:
- Created the Triangler Sea (formerly land) through magical catastrophe
- Scattered Pythagorean ruins containing dangerous geometric magic across the world
- Established the foundation for modern arcane traditions (including dwarven rune magic)

The Guild likely formed centuries after the collapse, as the Time Wizard gathered powerful allies to continue some aspect of Pythagorean work. Their exact founding date remains unclear, but their operations span millennia.



## **The Secret War**  
The Guild's primary adversary is the **Bartenders Guild**, a rival network created by **Mead** (a Fywick inventor and former Guild associate). This conflict reveals:
- **Mead's Motivation**: After being introduced to the Guild by Mordis Lux, he discovered something that prompted him to create his own shadow organization
- **Bartenders Guild Structure**: A spy network masquerading as tavern keepers and innkeepers
- **The Irony**: Both groups use adventurers as proxies, creating a recursive conflict

Key unresolved questions:
1. What secret did Mead uncover about the Guild's true purpose?
2. Why can't the Time Wizard simply eliminate this threat?
3. Is this conflict genuine or an elaborate misdirection?


## **Notable Interactions**  
The Guild's most documented interaction was with **Mordis Lux**:
- **Initial Contact**: Hired to gather gnomes named Gond (for reconstructing the gnomish god Gonzole)
- **Financial Arrangement**: Received an ongoing payment of "millions/billions" of gold for unspecified future services
- **Fywick Connection**: Operations in this region suggest interest in Pythagorean ruins beneath the Triangler Sea

Other confirmed activities:
- Manipulating adventurer groups across multiple cities/eras
- Possible coordination with the interdimensional Assassins' Guild
- Maintaining observation posts in key historical locations


## **Theories & Mysteries**  
The Guild's ultimate goals may involve:
- **Pythagorean Restoration**: Rebuilding the lost empire's magic/territory
- **Temporal Reckoning**: Correcting or preventing some future catastrophe
- **Reality Manipulation**: Using geometric magic to rewrite cosmic rules

Compelling evidence suggests:
- The Triangler Sea's triangular shape is no coincidence
- Their "random" jobs are actually placing components for a massive ritual
- The Time Wizard's calculations account for events centuries in the future
