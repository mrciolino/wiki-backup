# The West Sorea Trading Company
They are a merchant company in the dragon sea. They were docked in [Allford](/locations/Mardun/Allford) when the [Low Bar Brawlers](/organizations/low-bar-brawlers) [first arrived](/Events/chasing-thieves-in-allford) from [Kaltrosar Bay](/locations/Mardun/Kaltrosar).


[Captain John Robin](/characters/captain-john-robin) recommended the party speak with them about finding work.
