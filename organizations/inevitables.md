# **Inevitables**  
*Created by lawful neutral god-like robots, existing outside of time, and practically immortal.*  

The Inevitables are an order of divine constructs tasked with enforcing cosmic laws, agreements, and the natural order. They are not a traditional "race" or organization but function as celestial arbiters, akin to angels or modrons. Most were created by **Primus**, the lawful neutral god ruling Mechanus, though other deities may also commission them.  

### **Key Traits:**  
- **Immortal Constructs:** They do not age or die conventionally; damaged units teleport back to Mechanus for repairs.  
- **Enforcers of Law:** Their primary role is upholding divine contracts, natural balance, and punishing those who disrupt time, space, or cosmic agreements.  
- **Golden Discs:** Mortals can bind agreements via these discs, which Inevitables enforce—often violently.  

#### **Sources & Diversions from Lore:**  
| Aspect | Forgotten Realms | Mardun Universe |  
|--------|------------------|-----------------|  
| **Origin** | Created by Primus/Mechanus | Expanded to include other gods' directives |  
| **Golden Discs** | Rare, used for planar contracts | Common among interdimensional deals |  
| **Maruts** | Enforce agreements | Specialize in hunting "those who should be dead" |  



## **Link to the Mardun Universe**  
Maruts (golden disc enforcers) were deployed after the party—particularly *Spoops*—around **Sargossa**. Though some were destroyed, their remains may still linger on Mardun, posing potential discoveries for treasure hunters or scholars.  

### **Notable Events:**  
- **Marut Encounters:** The party fought Maruts **three times**, with the largest battle involving ~20 units.  
- **Destruction:** A few Maruts were permanently killed near Sargossa (unusual, given their self-repair mechanisms).  
- **Legacy:** Their remains could contain rare materials or dormant tech.  

> *"The Maruts in their specialty is trying to capture and or kill those who should be dead... it got a lot more hostile after a couple of events."*  


## **Types of Inevitables**  
Each subtype targets specific violations of cosmic law:  

| Type | Purpose | Notable Traits |  
|------|---------|----------------|  
| **Marut** | Enforces golden disc contracts | Relentless, teleports when near death |  
| **Organic Inevitables** | Punish nature disruptors | Flesh-like constructs, rare |  
| **Chronology Enforcers** | Hunt time-travelers | "Fucking bonkers" (transcript) |  
| **Deicide Preventers** | Stop unauthorized ascension | Highest-tier units |  


## **Mechanics & Weaknesses**  
### **How to Kill a Marut**  
1. **Prevent Teleportation:** Trap them in anti-magic fields or dimensional locks.  
2. **Overwhelm Healing:** Their shells self-repair slowly; sustained damage is key.  
3. **Break the Shell:** Their bodies are harder than steel—adamantine weapons recommended.  

> *"You just keep wailing on it... getting it into disrepair is one thing, but breaking it irreparably is another."*  

## **Trivia & Campaign Notes**  
- **Primus:** The robot-god behind most Inevitables.  
- **Mardun’s Maruts:** Their remnants near Sargossa could reappear in future plots.  
- **Bypassing Inevitables:** Gods can send them directly (no golden disc needed).
