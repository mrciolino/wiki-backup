# **The Pythagorean Empire**  
**They didn’t just use magic—they *invented* its rules.**

## **1. Founding: Nomads and the Geometric Cult**  
The Pythagorean Empire began as an alliance between **nomadic "line-walkers"** and a **geometric cult of arcanomancers**. For millennia, the nomads had followed the leylines intuitively, drawn to their magical currents like moths to flame. Meanwhile, the geometric cult of cartographers, astronomers, and proto-wizards (archanomancers), studied the leylines’ movements, correlating them with celestial patterns.

> *"The nomads were 80% of Pythas Prime’s population... their thousand-year wisdom met the cult’s newfound intellect."*  

Their breakthrough came with **runic magic**, the first formalized arcane system. By inscribing geometric symbols (notably triangles), they could mimic leyline effects—detecting magic (△), warding decay (△⃒), or inducing growth. This fusion of nomadic tradition and scholarly innovation birthed the Pythagorean Empire.

## **2. The Leylines: Cosmic Arteries of Magic**  
### **Nature of the Leylines**  
Created by **Mystra** as a means to distribute magic across Mardun, the three leylines are **straight, rotating, spinning arcs** that encircle the world. Each has a **positive pole** (beneficial effects) and an **antipode** (catastrophic inverse):  

1. **Vitality**: Growth/Life vs. Decay/Death  
2. **Insight**: Knowledge/Clarity vs. Forgetfulness/Madness  
3. **Flux**: Strength/Power vs. Natural Disasters/War  

> *"Their antipodes became hellscapes—Draco Fell’s corruption may stem from the Vitality antipode."*  

### **The Nail Towers**  
The Empire’s grand project was to **anchor the leylines** using six towers:  
- **Nail Towers**: Immobile anchors (e.g., the Nail of Insight).  
- **Focus Towers**: Prevented rotation, aligning all positive poles into a single location.  

Construction took centuries, as the towers had to be erected at precise astrological moments. The first success—nailing the **Leyline of Vitality**—marked the Empire’s rise.

## **3. Pythas Prime: The Grown Capital**  
Originally a barren stretch near modern **Vodice**, the **Leyline of Vitality**’s pole was harnessed to **raise an island** from the sea. Over generations, the land flourished into a paradise:  
- **Climate Control**: Eternal spring, hyperfertile soil.  
- **Architecture**: Towers of white stone, tricorn compasses adorning temples.  
- **Population**: 100,000, mostly former nomads (80%) who revered the cult as "line-priests."  

### **The Sinking**  
When the leylines broke free, the island—dependent on the Vitality pole—**collapsed into the sea**, forming the **Triangle Sea**. Ruins of Pythas Prime still lie beneath its waters, their runes glowing faintly in the depths.  


## **4. Arcanomancy: The First Formalized Magic System**  
### **Origins: From Intuition to Law**  
Prior to the Pythagoreans, magic was an **innate gift** (sorcery) or a divine boon. The Empire’s breakthrough was treating magic as a **calculable science**, governed by geometric laws tied to the leylines.  

> *"They didn’t just use magic—they dissected it. Triangles became their alphabet, the leylines their parchment."*  

### **Core Principles**  
1. **Leyline Resonance**:  
   - Runes derived power by mimicking leyline "frequencies."  
   - Example: A △ (triangle) could **detect magic** by echoing the Vitality Leyline’s growth signature.  

2. **Polarity Duality**:  
   - Every rune had an **inverse** (e.g., △⃒ for decay wards).  
   - *"To promote life, one must first understand death."*  

3. **Astrological Synchrony**:  
   - Spells were stronger when cast during **celestial alignments** that matched a leyline’s predicted path.  

### **Runic Magic in Practice**  
| Rune Shape | Effect                          | Leyline Source  | Limitations                  |  
|------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|  
| △          | Detect magic/Life detection     | Vitality        | Range: 100 ft                |  
| △⃒         | Ward against decay              | Vitality (anti) | Requires silver dust         |  
| ▽          | Negate minor spells             | Flux            | Shatters after 3 uses        |  
| ◻          | Store knowledge (1hr memory)    | Insight         | Only works at night          |  

**Key Innovation**:  
- **Non-Innate Casting**: Anyone could wield runes with training, birthing the first **wizards**.  
- **Leyline Batteries**: Focus towers stored excess energy, allowing spells beyond natural limits.  

### **The First Spellbook: *The Measured World***  
A foundational text etched on **indestructible white stone tablets**, containing:  
- **Runic Lexicon**: 47 verified geometric symbols.  
- **Leyline Almanac**: Predictions for optimal casting times.  
- **Taboos**: Forbidden shapes (e.g., circles) that "disturbed" leyline harmony.  

> *"At the ultimate centre, magic from multiple lines could be combined, and brought to their apex."*  

### **Legacy and Degradation**  
- **Modern Wizardry**: Pythagorean runes evolved into spells like *Detect Magic* and *Glyph of Warding*, though their geometric roots are forgotten.  
- **Lost Techniques**:  
  - **Tower Synergy**: Coordinated casting between nail/focus towers could **reshape landscapes**.  
  - **Antipode Manipulation**: Briefly harnessed antipode energy for catastrophic weapons (used in the **Dragon Wars**).  

### **The Immortality Pact**  
The cult promised the Emperor eternal life via the **Vitality Leyline**, though its success is unconfirmed. Some speculate the Emperor’s spirit lingers in the sunken ruins.  


## **5. The Fall: Theories and Aftermath**  
### **Causes**  
1. **Leyline Rebellion**: Natural energy overwhelmed the towers.  
2. **Divine Intervention**: Mystra undid their "unnatural" control.  
3. **Flying too close to the sun**: The arcanomancers attempted to wield too much power and caused the leyline array to break.

### **Successor Cultures**  
| Group          | Destination      | Leyline Influence | Legacy                     |  
|----------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|  
| Astronomers    | Celestial Veil   | Insight            | Oracles of Fywick           |  
| Warriors       | Heltholin        | Flux               | Helmeri berserker lodges   |  
| Vitalists      | Druidia          | Vitality           | Vodice’s druidic covens    |

## **6. Notable Individuals**  

### **Emperor of Pythas Prime**
### **The First Wizard**

### **Asmal, the Mad**  
- **Crime**: Attempted to "square the circle," defying sacred geometry. Sought to harness the power of the anipodes (decay, madness, disaster). 
- **Punishment**: His dangerous ideas led him to be imprisoned for life.
> *"Inferno, the last surviving dragon, may know the truth... but he avoids that cursed place."*

## **7. Trivia and Mysteries**  
- **Naming Rights**: Coined the term *Mardun* for the world, meaning "Motherland"
- **Aesthetic**: Ancient Greek-inspired, with tri-cornered tools and angular art.  
- **Demonic Origins?**: The antipodes’ corruption may have birthed the first demons.

<summary>The Living Towers</summary>  
Rumors persist of a **functional Nail Tower** in Vodice’s caves, guarded by a sect of rune-obsessed druids. Its activation could destabilize the leylines anew.

<summary>The Broken Rune</summary>  
A shattered rune (⚯) was discovered in Draco Fell’s ruins—possibly Asmal’s attempt to **fuse all three leylines**. If restored, it might reignite the Desolation of Asmal.
