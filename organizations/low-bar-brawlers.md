# The Low Bar Brawlers
The party of Campaign 1. They first assembled after each of them received a letter from [Illiard](/characters/illiard) asking them to gather at [Pope's Pub](/locations/Mardun/popes-pub) in [Fort Suro](/locations/Mardun/Fort-Suro) for an important job. Little did any of them know just how much that job would change the world.
