# Dolarion
The former prison of Iapetus and world anchoring the chains of carceri.

## First Visit
Spoops anr Elira first visited this world using the Well of Many Worlds whole escaping trial in Sigil. Their first visit was brief, only lasting moments.

## Destruction
Spoops returned to Dolarion through the Well of Many Worlds after his first fight against Zeus. He resolved to acquire more power here and used uis Compass to seek it out. The compass brought him to a mysterious metallic pillar and Spoops also began befriending a local village of Goblins. 

At this point, Bane appered from a magical gate. As usual Bane seemed to have his own agenda, and told Spoops he knew a way to get more powerful. In desperation, Spoops agreed to hear him out. Bane explained that they needed to activate all the pillars on the planet and they would be able to unlock more power. As they proceeded to do so, Spoops also felt inclined to convert these Goblins and build an army to bring home to Mortis Lux. Bane, who always enjoyed a bit of conquering, tagged along as they liberated the Goblins from an oppressive regime and conquered multiple villages. 

After conquering thr goblins, Bane and Spoops focused on quickly activating the remaining pillars. Using his magical eyes, Spoops could see magical runes inscribed on the pillars. The runs seemed to describe some sort of seal, but Spoops fid not pay it much mind, believing some sort of power was sealed within, ripe for the taking. He could also see magical energy flowing through the air between the pillars. Once they got to the last one, Spoops used an 11th level spell to activate the final pillar. However something seemed off as the ground began to shake and crack. Before Spoops could stop the process and back away, Bane grabbed ahold of Spoops, holding him in place. The two of them began rising into the air until they left the atmosphere. Then the planet exploded, chunks of earth flew all around as power surged into Bane and Spoops. Spoops looked on in horror as his Goblin friends were killed in an instant along with all other life on the planet. Then they saw it, A titan arose from within the ruins of the planet. 

Surrounded by a shattered prison once constructed of magical Titanite metal, the titan Iapetus emerged and looked upon Spoops. It thanked him for its freedom and took a massive chunk of titanite into its hands, crushing it down. Opening its hands it revealed a beautifully crafted and incredibly dense blade which it presented to Spoops before departing into the Astral Sea.
