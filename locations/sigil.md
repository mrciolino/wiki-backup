# Sigil
A mysterious city in the planes that is off limits to gods. 


## Divine Trial
As a neutral zone for the gods, trials and hearings are routinely held here, run by the archangels of the gods of [The Council of Gods](/organizations/council-of-gods). [Spoops](/characters/spoops) and [Elira](/characters/elira) were brought here by Marut for trial.
