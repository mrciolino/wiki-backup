# Tu'narath
Tu'narath was once home to the Githyanki before Spoops raised the titan corpse as an undead servant. It served as a military asset of Mortis Lux until its destruction during its battle with the titan Iapetus.


## Home of The Githyankii
Tu'narath was originally a titan slain by [Vlaakith](/characters/vlaakith). She then chained the corpse to her castle/phylactery and flew it throughout the astral sea. The home of the Githyankii was built upon the immense titan corpse. It served as the fortress and home of the Githyankii for millenia.


## Githyankii War
During the [Githyankii War](/Events/githyanki-war), the titan was raised by [Spoops](/characters/spoops) as an undead servant. During the battle, he used it to cripple the Gothyankii offensive by obliterating many of their ships and armies by swatting them like flies.

At the conclusion of the battle, [Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) teleported Tu'narath into orbit around [Mardun](/locations/Mardun).


## Ithilid War
During [The Ithilid War](/Events/ithilid-war), Tu'narath was equipped with a laser on one of his arms that was missing a hand. He was commanded to defend Mardun by attacking the Ithilid's Creature as it attempted to break through the crystal sphere.


## Iapetus
Some time after the conclusion of the Ithilid War, [Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos) and Spoops equipped the undead titan with massive robotic armor and weapons. They also installed controls to allow them to directly interface with their newly installed systems. After upgrading Tu'narath's capabilities, they piloted the new Mecha-Tu'narath into battle against the free titan [Iapetus](/characters/iapetus). During the battle, both Mecha-Tu'narath and Iapetus were destroyed, their viscera and machinery becoming a massive ring around [Mardun](/locations/Mardun).
