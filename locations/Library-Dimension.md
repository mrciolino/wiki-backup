## Origin and Nature of the Library Dimension

The Library Dimension is a distinct plane of existence dedicated to the accumulation and preservation of virtually all recorded knowledge throughout time. Unlike intangible concepts like memories or dreams, this dimension stores information in physical forms—books, scrolls, tablets, and other written media. While its precise origins remain unclear, evidence suggests it has existed for nearly as long as other dimensions, possibly emerging with the invention of writing itself.

Visually, the Library Dimension presents as an endless expanse of towering bookshelves and sprawling library structures extending to the horizon in all directions. The ground itself is littered with books, continuing deeper and deeper with no discernible bottom. Scholars debate whether there exists any actual ground beneath this literary foundation, or if the entire dimension is constructed upon layers upon layers of books.

As noted in the transcript: "*People do not know if there's an actual ground, actual stone or flow or something, or if it's just all built on the books. Which means technically, one good Dwarven Digging Group, and we might be able to get to the secrets of the universe by digging deep enough within the books.*"

## The Heart of Knowledge: The Great Tree and Central Sea

### The Great Tree of Knowledge

At the center of the Library Dimension lies its most remarkable feature—the Great Tree of Knowledge. This entity resides on floating islands situated within a tumultuous Storm of Knowledge that surrounds a vast Sea of Knowledge. The Tree functions as a living database, aggregating and storing information rather than creating it independently.

The Tree of Knowledge has recently been rejuvenated by Basvrah, a former assassin from the Baz Brothers (sometimes called the Baz Clan), who merged with the Tree to revitalize it. According to the transcript: "*The Tree of Knowledge has also been renewed as of late by a one Basvra, a former party member of the Baz clan, a former assassin himself... And he subsumed himself into the Tree of knowledge to give it a new lease on life, revigorate it.*"

When presented with new knowledge, the Tree creates appropriate vessels—books or other containers—to preserve this information. As one source explains: "*The tree takes the new knowledge... and creates a vessel for it. The author is always the creature who discovered it—the tree is merely the curator.*" The Tree itself doesn't generate knowledge but serves as its custodian.

### The Knowledge Storm and Sea

Surrounding the central islands is a mysterious Storm of Knowledge and a vast Sea of Knowledge. Despite multiple expeditions, including those by the Mortis Lux adventuring group who reportedly traveled through it "without much issue," little is understood about these phenomena. The transcript notes: "*No one has yet come back alive to tell us what is like to actually fly through the storm of knowledge and be struck...*" This suggests that while some have successfully navigated these regions, none have studied them in depth.

## Indigenous Inhabitants and Ecosystem

### Owl-like Bipedal Creatures

The most primordial inhabitants of the Library Dimension are mysterious owl-like bipedal beings that appear in two distinct varieties:

#### Smaller Variant
* Possess dexterous, humanoid-like hands with opposable thumbs
* Maintain limited flight capabilities
* Primarily engage in repairing damaged books, pamphlets, and papers
* Function as caretakers of the dimension's literary collection

#### Larger Variant
* Much more physically capable and aggressive
* Feature large elk-like antlers and sharp claws
* Fully capable of flight
* Primarily attack outsiders who threaten the library's contents

These creatures appear to form a self-sustaining ecosystem, with the larger variants defending the knowledge resources while the smaller ones maintain them. As one source theorizes: "*The larger owl-beings attack outsiders—perhaps to protect knowledge as their 'food source.' The smaller ones maintain the library's integrity.*"

Their reproduction remains mysterious, with no observed breeding patterns. The transcript speculates: "*We don't think they have any genitalia in at all. We don't think they're actually reproductive species. It may be an asexual process.*" This suggests they may perpetuate through magical or otherwise non-biological means.

### Other Notable Inhabitants

| **Creature**              | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bipedal Owl-Beings**     | - **Smaller Variant**: Dexterous, humanoid-handed repairers of damaged books. |
|                           | - **Larger Variant**: Aggressive, antlered, clawed defenders that attack outsiders. |
| **Driders (Lolth-Sworn)** | A later addition; colonies roam the library in small numbers. |
| **Angels & Demons**       | Eternal war over sections containing divine/infernal secrets (e.g., godly weaknesses, battle plans). |
| **Jigglypuff**            | A spirit guardian of the Tree of Knowledge—no further details known. |
| **Sentient Books**        | Some books possess sentience and volatility, described as potentially "man-eating." |

The Angels and Demons create "no-go zones" that even the native owl creatures avoid, engaged in constant warfare over sections containing divine and infernal knowledge about weaknesses, strengths, and battle plans of their respective factions.

## The Librarian System and Special Privileges

Powerful magical beings who enter the Library Dimension can attain special status as "Librarians," granting them enhanced capabilities and privileges. As the transcript notes: "*Librarians get special powers and privileges bestowed upon them when they assume this mantle. And part of the library dimension itself seems to give way to them.*"

### Becoming a Librarian

The requirements and process for becoming a Librarian remain somewhat obscure, but known elements include:

1. The candidate must be a "powerful magical being"
2. They must visit specific locations within the dimension where rare knowledge is stored
3. They must interact with "shrines of knowledge" (described as giant books containing deep lore)
4. The process involves some form of "Eldridge process" not fully understood

As one source summarizes: "*Librarians 'get a library card'—a metaphysical key to the dimension's secrets.*" This suggests an official recognition within the dimension's mysterious organizational structure.

### Librarian Abilities

Once attained, Librarian status confers several benefits:
* Enhanced navigation ability within the dimension
* Intuitive sense of the books and knowledge surrounding them
* Possible combat advantages (as suggested by a Titan who became a Librarian to gain combat advantage against the Mortis Lux group)
* Ability to grant "library cards" to others, potentially extending some privileges

## Temporal Anomalies and Future Knowledge

One of the most profound mysteries of the Library Dimension involves its relationship with time. The dimension experiences significant time dilation effects, where temporal flow varies drastically compared to other planes of existence.

### Time Dilation Effects

The temporal inconsistencies within the Library Dimension are extreme and unpredictable. As one source explains: "*You could spend a week in the library and return to find only ten minutes passed—or vice versa.*" This temporal distortion makes extended visits particularly risky, as explorers may return to find their home world significantly changed.

### Future Texts and Predestination

Perhaps most remarkably, the Library Dimension contains knowledge from the future, including:
* Books written by people about events that have not yet occurred
* Autobiographies of living people describing future experiences they haven't yet lived through

As the transcript describes: "*Texts from the future written by people in the present about events that are going to happen, but have not occurred yet, their resolution and how they solved them have appeared in the library dimension where someone lives out their life and writes their autobiography and then they go to the library dimension and they find the autobiography but not as when they write it later in life but way before like when in their prime.*"

### Historical Impact of Time Anomalies

The unpredictable temporal nature of the Library Dimension has had tangible consequences:
* The Gith Potion Factory once operated within the dimension
* Operations became "unsustainable due to time dilation"
* The facility was eventually removed from the dimension

## Organization System and the Dewey Decimal Mystery

Knowledge within the Library Dimension appears to be auto-sorted into thematic sections, with similar types of information clustering together. Examples include:
* Assassination notes accumulating into a mountain
* Angelic and demonic knowledge concentrating in contested regions
* Presumably separate areas for cookbooks, diaries, and other categories

The organizing principle behind this sorting remains one of the dimension's greatest mysteries. The transcript cryptically references "Dewey Decimal" as an enigmatic figure or force that may control this organization, described as an "Eldritch being" whose name "*terrifies the owl-beings*" and "*sends shivers down the spine of the bipedal owl-like creatures.*"

As one source amusingly notes: "*The deepest lore masters found one name: Dewey Decimal. Its meaning? 'We have no idea what the fuck it means.'*"

## Notable Expeditions and Interactions

### The Mortis Lux Chronicles
This adventuring group has provided much of our knowledge about the Library Dimension through their expeditions. Their accomplishments include:
* Successfully navigating the Storm of Knowledge multiple times
* Interacting with the Tree of Knowledge
* Documenting the time-altering effects of the dimension
* Encountering Basvrah after his merger with the Tree

### The Titan Encounter
A Titan (possibly sent by Bahamut) became a Librarian to gain advantage in combat against explorers, demonstrating the tactical benefits of this status.

### Adalynn's Library Card
References to "Adalynn's Library Card" hint at a formalized system for accessing the dimension's power, suggesting others have successfully navigated the requirements to gain special privileges within the Library.

## Unanswered Mysteries

Many aspects of the Library Dimension remain unexplored or unexplained:

1. **The Pre-Basvrah Tree Consciousness**
   * What entity or consciousness inhabited the Tree of Knowledge before Basvrah?
   * The transcript suggests it might be "a one of many or many to one type thing" or an "inclaration of soul"
   * Post-merger, the tree's consciousness may be a fusion of souls or an eternal entity

2. **The Storm of Knowledge**
   * What is the true nature of the storm surrounding the central islands?
   * Why has no detailed exploration of this phenomenon been recorded?

3. **The "Raunchier" Literature**
   * Despite the dimension supposedly containing all written knowledge, certain categories of adult literature remain undiscovered
   * "*Where none have seemed too straight far enough to find the smart. We know it's out there somewhere technically because mortals make that, but it's not been found.*"

4. **The True Nature of the Dewey Decimal System**
   * What power or entity organizes the dimension's contents?
   * Is "Dewey Decimal" an actual being with agency or a principle of organization?

The Library Dimension stands as one of the most fascinating and dangerous planes of existence, offering boundless knowledge at the risk of temporal displacement, hostile guardians, or worse—getting lost in the stacks forever. As one source aptly describes it, this realm is "*treacherous yet invaluable*" for those bold enough to seek its secrets, where the rewards may be beyond imagination—but so too are the perils.
