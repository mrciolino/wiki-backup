### **Library Dimension: Detailed Summary**  

The **Library Dimension** is a vast, enigmatic plane of existence dedicated to the accumulation and preservation of nearly all recorded knowledge, written works, and information in physical form—such as books, scrolls, and tablets. Unlike memories or dreams, which are intangible, the Library Dimension stores knowledge in tangible, retrievable formats. Its origins are unclear, but it has existed for nearly as long as other dimensions, possibly since the creation of writing itself. The dimension is structured as an endless expanse of towering bookshelves, sprawling libraries, and mountains of books with no discernible ground beneath them—some speculate the entire dimension is built upon layers of books.  

#### **Key Features of the Library Dimension**  

1. **The Great Tree of Knowledge**  
   - At the center of the dimension lies a **storm-ridden sea of knowledge**, with floating islands hosting the **Great Tree of Knowledge**.  
   - The tree acts as a living database, **aggregating and storing knowledge** rather than creating it. When new knowledge is offered, the tree creates a vessel (a book, tablet, etc.) to contain it.  
   - The tree was **rejuvenated by Basvrah**, a former assassin from the Baz Brothers (or Baz Clan), who merged with it to give it new life.  
   - The tree also contains knowledge from the **future**, suggesting a connection to **time dilation** within the dimension.  

2. **Inhabitants & Ecosystem**  
   - **Bipedal Owl-like Creatures**:  
     - **Smaller Variant**: Dexterous, humanoid-handed beings that **repair damaged books** and maintain the library’s integrity.  
     - **Larger Variant**: Aggressive, elk-antlered creatures with sharp claws that **attack outsiders**, possibly to protect knowledge as a food source (they may "consume" knowledge to sustain themselves).  
     - Their reproduction is **asexual or magical**, with no clear biological process.  
   - **Driders (Lolth-Sworn)**: A colony of driders inhabits the dimension, though they are a **later addition** compared to the primordial owl-beings.  
   - **Angels & Demons**: These factions **constantly battle** over sections of the library containing divine and infernal secrets (e.g., weaknesses of gods, demon lords, battle strategies). Their war zones are avoided by other inhabitants.  
   - **Jigglypuff**: A mysterious **spirit guardian** of the Tree of Knowledge, with no further details known.  

3. **Librarians & Special Privileges**  
   - **Powerful beings** can become **Librarians**, granting them enhanced navigation skills and an intuitive sense of the library’s contents.  
   - The process involves interacting with **shrines of knowledge** (giant books containing deep lore) in rare sections of the dimension.  
   - A **Titan** sent to attack a party (possibly by Bahamut) became a Librarian to gain an advantage, indicating the role offers **combat or knowledge-based buffs**.  

4. **Time Dilation & Future Knowledge**  
   - Time flows **erratically**—spending a day inside could mean minutes or weeks have passed outside.  
   - Books from the **future** appear in the library, including **autobiographies written by people who haven’t lived those events yet**.  
   - The **Gith Potion Factory** once operated here but was removed due to **time instability** making production unsustainable.  

5. **Organization & the Dewey Decimal System**  
   - Knowledge is **auto-sorted** into themed sections (e.g., assassination notes in one area, angelic/demonic lore in another).  
   - The **Dewey Decimal System** is cryptically referenced as an **Eldritch force** governing this organization, though its true nature is unknown.  

6. **Unanswered Mysteries**  
   - **What existed before Basvrah merged with the Tree of Knowledge?** The tree’s prior consciousness is unknown—it may be a **conglomeration of souls** or an eternal entity.  
   - **Why is there a storm around the Tree of Knowledge?** No one has survived exploring it deeply.  
   - **Where is the "raunchier" literature?** Despite mortal authorship, such texts remain undiscovered in the library’s depths.  

#### **Notable Events & Interactions**  
- **Mortis Lux Chronicles**: A group that explored the dimension, interacted with the Tree of Knowledge, and documented its time-altering effects.  
- **Adalynn’s Library Card**: Suggests a formalized system for accessing the dimension’s power.  
- **Angels vs. Demons War**: An eternal conflict over hidden divine/infernal knowledge.  

The Library Dimension remains one of the most **dangerous yet rewarding** planes, where seekers of knowledge risk deadly encounters with its guardians—or worse, getting lost in time itself.
