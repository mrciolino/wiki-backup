## Events
- Starting location of the campaign.
- In the tavern, 12 of us (Nick, Michelle, Carson, Dan, Matt, Spoon, Sean, Cat, Breezy, Stef, Peter, Pope) met during Session 0.
- We were all called to meet a mysterious caller at the tavern (letters for a lucrative adventuring job) and sat down together.
- Stef stole from behind the bar and left the party.
- Spoops was choking Os (he was offended).
- Breezy E (a samurai) tried to call a tornado (not a spell) and rolled a Nat 1. This happened to Lucini.
- Kat got the guards (because of Spoops vs. Os, but the demon was there too). Now Spoops fought the guards alongside the demon and seduced the demon Lucini. A romantic moment ensues, and Lucini gives Spoops a weird stone with a glyph (alongside some vials of blood and hair).
- Otto Hurtzog didn’t like Os’s bard antics, so he fired an arrow and knocked Os unconscious. Trying to help Os, Freedom arrives to defend him. Freedom goes to fight Lucini (Lucini dies, but his body disappears) -> Lucini possesses Freedom before disappearing.
- We rest (SESSION 2, Lucini in Freedom’s body gives us a quest) to free some slaves, but Lucini tells us to ask the guard captain for help. The captain says to clear the iron mines of goblins.
- Spoops stops at a local church on the way to the mine but didn’t get the blessing he was looking for from the priests.
- We went into the iron mine, fought some goblins, and found Bomb the Bear in a chest. Os died to multiple arrows and getting hit by a minecart (however, Drakham does a wild magic surge and randomly gets resurrected - Os is the same race).
- Krorg suplexes Bomb the Bear into a chest and carries him out.
- The goblin captain on our way out rolls a cannon out and fires it at us, but we are still in the cave, so we dodge out of the way.
- We take the captain alive and stuff him into the cannon to bring him back to the guard. He says the merchant transport is going to a fishing village, and we join them on the journey.
