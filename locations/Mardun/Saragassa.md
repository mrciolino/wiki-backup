Saragassa was both a city and an island in the northern dragon sea, colloquially known as Pirate Island. It was a haven for pirates and their base for raiding and commerce, surrounded by thick jungle and unexplored ruins that keep most away but those seeking to do business with or join the pirates. It was a bustling trading hub and gathering point for the many pirate groups of the northern dragon sea, and the seat of the Pirate King who loosely rules over them.

# Fall of Saragassa
In the middle of the Great Pirate Raid of Alford, the dreaded Rathwing attacked Saragassa while most of the pirates were gone. He teleported to the island to ancient summoning circles and brought with him a legion of bone spiders. Laying siege to Saragassa, all remaining pirates there were killed except for Bazz 1 and the Pirate King who managed to escape aboard a ship (the Pirate King would later on be killed by Bazz 1, making Bazz 1 the sole survivor). 

On the return journey after a successful raid, the newly elected pirate king Krorg noticed that Saragossa had been overrun and decided to make a U turn and establish Alford as the new pirate capital city. By expertly combining the names "Alford" and "Saragassa" the new city of "Altricia" was named and settled.

It is unclear if Saragassa was ever reclaimed after the bone spider invasion.

# Notable Characters
- Bugbear Captain: The name says it all
- Maria Luigi
- Dave Bones: Really bad guy who cannot die as long as his name is known.
- Knott Em'Portent: One of the few pirates to survive Dave Bone's leadership, would become the top enforcer for King Krorg and the guardian of Krorgfrey. 

# Organizations
- Pirate Lords
	A group of high ranking pirates, each with control of their own fleet. They can be called upon to serve the Pirate King in times of great need.
- Pirate Kings
	- The First Pirate King: A legendary figure who raided ships from the City of Torment, and gave birth to this specific form of naval bandirty.
	- Unnamed Pirate King: The one in charge when Krorg initiated the Great Pirate Raid of Alford. Deceptive and lazy, he was also the boss of Dave Bones and sent him on lots of dirty missions like stealing Freedom's soul to power a massive warship. Unfortunately he got played by Krorg who told Bazz 1 to stay behind during the raid to kill him, so that Krorg could succeed him as the new Pirate King.
  - King Krorg of Altricia: After being appointed raid captain in charge of the pirate lords, Krorg pulled some seditious shenanigans to ensure that he would come out on top. With all his major rivals dead (The Pirate King, Dave Bones, Rathwing), Krorg had a strong position to re-establish the pirates and Altricia as a legitimate state and economic powerhouse of the Dragon Sea.
  - Spoops: Technically steward of the pirate throne until Krorgfrey comes of age, Spoops led a massive military buildup of the Altricia pirates and eventually incorporated them into his even larger group Mortis Lux. Spoops would then take *ALL* the pirates into space to fight the illithid empire. 
  - Krorgfrey I of Geskoworn: The rightful blood heir of the pirate throne of Altricia, Krorgfrey inherited very little from Spoops. Krorgfrey would reliquish the title of Pirate King given how there were no more pirate organizations in the Dragon Sea and so he could focus his efforts on rebuilding New Geskoworm. The title of King of Altricia was willingly handed over to Luther, a ranking liutenant of Mortis Lux.
