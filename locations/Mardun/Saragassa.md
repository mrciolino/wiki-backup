A city on an island in the northern dragon sea, also known as Pirate Island. It is a haven for pirates and their base for raiding and commerce, surrounded by thick jungle and unexplored ruins that keep most away but those seeking to do business with or join the pirates. It is home to a bustling trading hub and gathering point for the many pirate groups of the northern dragon sea, and the seat of the Pirate King who loosely rules over them.
