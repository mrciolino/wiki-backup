The city and nation of Wegate are a theocracy ruled by the Church of the Soul Warden. It is mainly populated by Yuan-ti, but since the construction of the Southern Docks, it has become a hub of trade and the world's largest shipyard. The city of Wegate is highly defended by a large military force composed of Yuan-ti soldiers, Paladins, Clerics, and undead creatues. By the time of the Ithilid War, every single graveyard within the nation of Wegate was emptied, and the corpses were used to build up the armies of Mortis Lux.

Prior to Vesrahan's rebellion, the city had a large population of faithful followers of a god most of the world had forgotten, Ry-ann. Long ago, Wegate was ruled by the Avatar of Ry-ann/Spoops. Since that time the religion of the Soul Warden remained dominant in the city, however over time if stopped being a theocracy and became a kingdom. However after The Low Bar Brawlers arrived, Spoops and Vesrahan met and began a rebellion which resulted in the conquest of the city, and return of theocratic rule.
