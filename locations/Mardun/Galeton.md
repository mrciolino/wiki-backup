# Galeton
Galeton is a fishing town near the city of Kaltrussar Bay. The Town is a fishing village of the Kingdom of Kaltrussar.

## Information
- Population: 236

## Notable Characters
- Gaurdison Senior, father of the Guardison met by LBB from Fort Suro.
- The Yellow Lobster, Frederina's warlock patron.
- The Badger Spirit

## Events
- On the way to the village, some bandits attempt to rob us on the highway. Some party members sneak around and find the bandit stash. Os plays a song to distract the bandits.
- This is where Spoops gets the Wind Amulet and we discover a nature shrine with many badgers. Here, we meet Senior Gaurdison (father of the previous Gaurdison).
- The tavern in the fishing village is called "The Wispy Rat."
- We receive gold for protecting a merchant caravan.
- Kat, Os, and Drakham hang around the docks. Frederina's patron, a yellow lobster, appears to Frederina. A void portal opens, and Os and Drakham join Kat in jumping into the void, encountering lots of teeth and evil patron vibes.
- Federina accepts servitude to her patron. Os and Drakham agree to help her as well.
- The Wind Amulet needs to be recovered so Gaurdison can man the lighthouse, but Spoops really wants it. We go to get it; Drakham gets it first and places it in a lockbox at the nature shrine. Spoops breaks into the lockbox, angering the spirit who summons badgers. In response, Federina sets the forest on fire.
- Crow helps us stop the fire from burning the town. After that, we follow the merchant caravan to the big city, Kaltrazar Bay.
