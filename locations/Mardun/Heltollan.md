# Heltollán
Continent on [Mardun](/locations/Mardun) which is home to many famous location such as [Gothriathon](/locations/Mardun/Gothriathon). Sometimes known colloquially as the "Southern Continent". It is a very hilly and mountainous region, and ancestral home to the dwarves. The continent is named for Helmaer, an ancient dwarvish king who ruled the region before he and his empire was destroyed for its hubris. The continent borders the White Wastes, an inhospitable frozen landscape where life cannot exist. Helmaer in his foolishness sought to dig deep tunnels beneath the earth to penetrate the secrets of the White Wastes, but was unsuccessful in his endeavours.
