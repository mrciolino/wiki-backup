# Mortis Lux Flying City

The Mortis Lux Flying City is the legendary headquarters of the Mortis Lux organization—a massive, multi-planar alliance founded to combat existential threats like the Ithilids. This city exists as a vast, fortified island floating within its own demiplane, originally created and anchored to the soul of the archmage [Adalynn](/characters/adalynn). After Adalynn's death, stewardship of the city and its demiplane was soul-surgically transferred to [Illiard](/characters/lucidel-illiard).

## Creation & Access

- **Demiplane Origin:** The city was conjured by Adalynn, who bound its existence to her soul, making access and egress possible only with her (or later, Illiard's) permission.
- **Security:** The city is protected by powerful magical wards, undead legions, and a small group of living Mortis Lux members. Illiard, as regent, oversees operations and defense.

## Structure & Features

- **Floating Fortress:** The city is a self-contained, mobile fortress, capable of traversing any breathable location and serving as a command center for Mortis Lux.
- **Shipyards:** Spelljammer ships are produced at the Wegate Southern Docks and docked here, providing the organization with interplanar mobility.
- **Factories:** Includes advanced facilities such as the [Forge Dimension](/locations/Forge-Dimension) for artifact creation, AI robot factories, and the Speaking Stone Factory for long-distance magical communication.
- **Residences & Halls:** Home to the Highlords ([Spoops](/characters/spoops), [Breezy-E](/characters/breezy), [Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos), [Adalynn](/characters/adalynn)), their lieutenants, and various allies.

## Leadership & Governance

- **Highlords:** The supreme leaders of Mortis Lux, with ultimate authority over the city and organization.
- **Regent:** When the Highlords are absent, a regent (currently Illiard) manages the city and its resources.
- **War Council:** Advises on military and strategic matters.

## Role in the Campaign

- **Headquarters:** Served as the central hub for planning and launching// filepath: locations/mortis-lux-flying-city.md
