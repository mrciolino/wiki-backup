# Well of Souls

The divine realm of Spoops. The well of souls is the machinery behind life and death in the multiverse. It has always been. The realm appears as a dark rocky cave, at its center, is a single stone well on the floor. Countless souls flow upwards infinitely from the well to an identical stone well on the ceiling. The deluge of Souls glow a bright blue, illuminating the cave. 

By default, all souls would flow through the well. They flow up and out into the bodies of new born creatures, and those to be resurrected or reborn. Through this process, Death is not the end, simply a gateway to new or continued life.

## The Beginning
In the beginning, before the creation of worlds and birth of the old gods, The Well existed and Spoops crafted each individual soul until the well was overflowing with them. To contain them all he built a second well on the ceiling to infinitely cycle the souls. Eventually Spoops heard a ruckus outside the door to the realm, he looked out and saw Gods creating the mortal races. Empty vessels in need of souls! As the first beings were formed Spoops quickly opened the floodgates, allowing the Well's infinite cycle of souls to flow through the universe, each time a new creature was born, they inherited a soul, which upok death passed back into the well's flowing current.

## The Heavens
At the death of the first devout worhipper of another God, a precedent was set. The soul did not return to the Well, instead it ascended to the "heaven" within the Divine Realm of that God. Spoops was not particularly bothered by this. Perhaps a bit curious as to why someone would lock a soul away "forever" in a heaven. However it did not matter as he believes all Souls will one day return to the cycle, eternities are long and the Well is forever.

### Limitations
Souls are unable to return to the Well if they are bound by contracts, imprisonment, or ownership of the soul is held by a third party, or other means.

Example: If a soul is owned by another God, it will not return to thr Well but instead will be controlled by that God.

## Extreme Boredom
For eons, Souls cycled through the Well. Spoops read their stories as returned, and gazing into the Well he watched mortals live their lives. Eventually he grew bored of just watching and reading, he wanted to experience adventure for himself. He gazed into the well and upon seeing a particularly interesting world, he jumped in. The Well was not exactly designed to transport a living creature somewhere, so while it was able to grt close to his desired location, the flow of the well spit Spoops out through thr nearest body of water. Spoops also hit his head on the way in, Splitting his own body and Divine essence. His Deified Eseence was left behind to form its own ego, Ry-ann, while his body washer ashore with a foggy memory. 


## Appearances In the Campaign

The Well appeared twice in campaign 1. 

### Ascention of Spoops
Spoops gained enough power in the material plane to achieve 12th level magic, and regained enough of his memories to learn who he truly was. Used the 12th level spell Divine Command on himself to reunite with Ry-ann to regain his former Divine power. Upon doing so, the door to The Well was opened once again where his divine persona Ry-ann sat on a bony rocky "throne". Spoops and Ry-ann became one and stood alone in the Realm before Adalynn opened a gate to return him to the party.

### Death of The Emperor
When the crown of Karsus exploded, Spoops lept into the Realm to escape the blast. After discussing victory with his party, he was jumping into the Well to make a dramatic entrance back into the material plane (instead of using the door). When he once again hit his head on the Well, separating his divine ego from his body. He decided to let himself (his body) have some fun while he dealt with the many tasks he had over the next 1000 years. He gave his Spoops Body some basic info before departing. 


### Campaign 2
At the start of the second campaign, Spoops completes his 1000 years of work, returning to the Well only to notice what he had been to0 distracted to see before. His religion had gone through a schism and his friend's were quite busy with their own issues.

The Spoops (body) spent most of the last 1000 years adventuring throughout different worlds, but was now on Mardun, fully aware of the current events of the world and aware of their divinity but also unable to get the divine Spoops' attention, he played many roles over 1000 years, but only returned to Mardun in recent times. Now that the 1000 year quest is over, reuniting with Divine Spoops is imminent.


## The Death Domain Agreement
As part of the Treaty between Mortis Lux and the Council of Gods, Spoops agreed to cede the portfolio of Death to Kelemvor and they worked out an agreement on how Souls were to be treated and delivered throughout the cosmos. As in the behinning, before Spoops gained the portfolio of Death from Jergal, unbound souls would return to the Well, and Souls bound to Gods would flow through Kelemvor to their individual God's domains.


## Souls
### Composition
Souls are an integral part of all mortal life. They are composed of a matrix of energy whose complex design defines an individual. It contains the base personality traits, latent potential, base power, and memory. Souls come in two varieties, Original and Reborn. Original Souls are freshly created, In the beginning, all souls were Original. Reborn souls have lived and died, having gone through the Well at least once. Most Souls in existence are Reborn and contain a tightly sealed record of the momories of their past lives. 

### Base Personality
Defined in a Soul's energy matrix, the base personality is a blueprint on which that souls consciousness is created. It does not determine good or evil, it is a basic definition of personality traits such as Extraversion, Agreeableness, Openness, Conscientiousness, and Neuroticism.

### Base Power
Souls are composed of a matrix of energy. The amount of energy present in a given soul varies and influences the power (physical or magical) the soul possesses at birth.

### Latent Potential
Each Soul contains its own latent potential. This is the maximum amount of energy (physical or magical) a given soul is capable of wielding in their lifetime without damage. This is not a hard limit and can be increased through training and effort. Souls with a higher latent potential find attaining power (physical or magical) easier and can increase in strength more quickly/easily than those with lower latent potential. 

### Memory
Each Soul contains a record of their memories. Upon each soul's death, the memories of that lifetime are sealed away to allow a fresh beginning during their next life. This is the most commonly overridden parameter within a soul. Many magical creatures who resurrect or rebirth themselves via spells are unknowingly overriding the mechanism that seals memories, bringing themselves or others back intact.
