# Krorgs Hometown

# Overview
Formerly known as **North Geskoworm**, it is a village in the far north of the western continent. It is the home of several gnomish clans, who make up the bulk of its population. The village has seen its share of significant events.

# History
North Geskoworm was founded by gnomish exiles who were sent away to live in the arctic as punishment for being really annoying. They named their village North Geskoworm because it was in the far north, and Geskoworm was a combination of 9 letters that sounded cool. Over time the harsh climate froze the joyful smiles and temperment that was common amoung these gnomes, and rarely a laugh was heard nor a joke told. So North Geskoworm was split between the optimistic gnomes who sought to preserve their former spirits, and the pessimistic gnomes who just try to make it by surviving. 

One day a half-gnome named Gilthur tried his luck at becoming the new chief, but his jokes were so bad and foul that he was exiled forever, never to return until he told the funniest joke ever. So shameful and terrible was his humor that the villagers united together to cast an obscuring spell over the village, so that nobody would remember it as the place where Gilthur came from. From then on, North Geskoworm was called Krorg's Hometown.

# Geography
Located far to the north, Krorg's Hometown is in a very cold tundra. There isn't much else in the area, nor useful natural resources. 

# Population
The population is almost entirely gnomes, totally about 500. There are the occasional wanderers, vagabonds, and tourists who visit. The town attracts tourists because of its strange gnomish culture. For example, every year they decide who the next supreme dictator will be based on a comedy show. 

# Government
Krorg's Hometown is ruled by a bizzarre system where absolute power is given to whoever can tell the best joke. I think the word "Ridiocracy" would best describe this. Being unfunny is seen as a particularly capital offense usually dealt with via death (tied to a tree until you freeze to death) or banishment (freeze out in the wastes). 

# Economy
Krorg's Hometown is largely self sufficient. Its remote location in the tundra makes it poor for trading. With a large population of gnomes, they produce well crafted goods, but mostly keep them for themselves.

# Notable Locations
- **Kayla's Grave**: The final resting spot of Krorg's wife and former queen of Altricia. ~Questionably~ ~Canon~

# Important Characters
- **Krorg's extended family**
- **Village leader**
