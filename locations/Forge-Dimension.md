### Speaking Stone Factory v3

The speaking stone factory was created to answer the communications problem. As the party leveled up our mobility (especially with Naracus and [Adalynn's](/characters/adalynn) teleporting abilities) skyrocketed. [Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos) took this opportunity to be the central communication network for [Mortis Lux](/organizations/mortis-lux) and for [Mardun](/locations/Mardun). To achieve this a central patch panel ran by Communication Bots for used to act as a middle man for all speaking stones.Â 

-   Normal Speaking Stone (v1)
    -   Default stone that can cast only cast sending to a paired speaking stone.
-   Green speaking Stone (v2)
    -   A speaking stone which is tied to another speaking stone at Speaking Stone Communication Network Center in the Forge Dimension.
-   Blue Speaking Stone (7P) (v3)
    -   To handle failed calls with the Green Speaking Stone, 7 speaking stones were combined into 1 stone which parallelized the communication which allows for a 99.9973% success rate or a 1d37k for 4 calls. (10% chance that sending fails across dimensions)

#### Speaking Stone Communication Network

-   A switchboard to connect any 2 speaking green or blue speaking stones. Run by v2 AI Bots, this allowed Bazzdos to oversee all communication and security for Mortis Lux.

-   **Lens Factory**: A sub factory of the laser factory which handled the optics
-   F**ireproof Wood Factory**: A sub factory of the laser factory which handled laser testing and validation.
