# Elemental Plane of Chaos
A plane of pure chaotic energy where primordial forces and magic thrive.


## The Library Window
Bazzdos found a window in the [Library Dimension's Forbidden Section](/locations/library-dimension/forbidden-section), which transported him to the elemental plane of chaos.


## The Spawning Stone
Within this plane is a vortex of primordial energy called thr [Spawning Stone](/locations/elemental-plane-of-chaos/spawning-stone) from which an infinitely growing pillar of mithril crystal emerges. [Rabiah](/characters/rabiah) the storm giant built her golem factory around this vortex, utilizing the mithril in her creations.
