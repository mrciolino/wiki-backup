# Ereriad

Ereriad is the second world visited by the Low Bar Brawlers. It is home to various factions such as the Magic College of Porthy, The Fortress of Aphyr the Mighty, the Witch King, and more.

The party first arrived here through [Spoop](/characters/spoops)'s [Well-Of-Many-Worlds](/items/Well-Of-Many-Worlds). After looking through the portal and seeing a group of people running from a giant scorpion, they leapt through and began their journey.
