# Pirate Campaign
A high-seas heist unraveled into betrayal, transformation, and legend as cursed magic, monstrous hunger, and shifting loyalties reshaped the fate of pirates and empires alike.

## Summary

The heist set up by the most famous Pirate of that generation Garret Gibbens was a success but quickly afterwards the other captains Brutalus and Balthier started to mess with the Lich artifact from the Tevian navy admiral's ship and it turned Brutalus in to a Bone Rat Ogre. The two drunk crewmates also watching over the treasure wouldn't gather raw meat for the new Brutalus so Brutalus killed one and ate him, this caused the other crewmate to go to Gibbens reporting a monster in the hold. Clack Wheeze with Gibbens crew then started to fight the new monstrous Brutalus. Durring this fight Cal Valus decided to GTFO and go Live with the mer-people but cast waterbreathing on himself, first mate jack, and clack wheeze before abandoning ship. After a brutal fight Gibbens, Clack Wheeze and Gibbens' entire crew except for his first mate Jack was killed leaving Balthier and Brutalus as the only one able to split the loot. After this climatic ending to the heist, Cal Valus would spend the rest of his life living with the mermaids  as he was able to perpetually cast waterbreathing upon himself. Cal Valus would be very popular among the mermaids given his magic, exceptional people skills given he could read the mer people's minds. He would enjoy this life until he was old with many children, perishing to a rather aggressive dragon turtle. First Mate Jack survived the fight against Brutalus and Balthier but what happened to him is unknown. Brutalus in his new Bone Rat Form would given in to the voice in his head and his cravings for flesh and make a lair in Tevia causing its downfall with by spreading a plague that caused bone spiders to erupt from the dead's corpses , causing it to become known as the Shrine of Torment, City of the Last Lantern.
