# Woolhope

In Woolhope, three eccentric thrallsâ€”spaghetti warlock Alfredo, vampire Kael, and amnesiac doctor Royâ€”serve their vampiric patron Rye Linguinius in a magically sealed village caught between warring factions. Their world unravels after discovering Arfer, a marked soldier from beyond the barrier, leading to chaotic schemes: kidnapping village elder Aynuk to conceal Arferâ€™s identity, disguising him with stolen shears and makeup, and scrambling to hide him as rival delegates arrive for a tense neutrality dinner, all while ominous signs of betrayal and supernatural threats stir beneath the villageâ€™s uneasy peace.

    ðŸ“– <strong>Session 2</strong> ðŸ“– 

In the second session of Woolhope, the trio's desperate plan spirals into chaos as Alfredo investigates a bloody rag at the shepherd's farm and becomes convinced of murder, Roy and Kael botch multiple escape attempts through windowsâ€”resulting in bruised bodies and bruised egosâ€”and their hostage Aynuk surprisingly cooperates as they prepare a reckless disguise for Arfer using stolen shears and vampire makeup, only for tensions to skyrocket when both warring factions' delegates arrive separately for a neutrality dinner, forcing the party into improvised roles as restaurant staff while hiding a barely-concealed Arfer in the storage room and discovering unsettling clues about the supposedly dead shepherd's mysterious neck wound.

  ### **[Session Metadata]**
- **Date:** May 1st 2025
- **Session Number:** 2
- **Duration:** 2 hours
- **Players Present:** All (Cam/Roy, Nick/Alfredo Fettuccini, Matthew/Kael Virethorn)

### **[Recap of Previous Session]**
The party - vampire spawn serving patron Rye Linguineas - discovered Arfer, a wounded Narasine soldier, near their magically shielded village of Wolhope. Recognizing his presence could disrupt impending peace negotiations between the warring Narasine and Wegation factions, they kidnapped village elder Ainuk to conceal Arfer's arrival. Their current plan involves disguising Arfer as Ainuk using his beard while hiding the real Ainuk. Alfredo went searching for sheep shears to facilitate the disguise while Kael and Roy transported Ainuk to Linguineas' manor.

**Unresolved Plot Threads:**
1. Will the beard disguise successfully fool village observers?
2. What consequences will come from kidnapping Ainuk?
3. Why was Arfer left untouched near the barrier?
4. What are the true intentions of the arriving diplomatic delegations?
5. How will the party maintain Wolhope's neutrality?
6. What caused the bloody rag at Mikhail's farm?
7. Is Mikhail's wife actually unfaithful or is there another explanation?
