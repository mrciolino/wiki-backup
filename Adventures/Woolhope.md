# Woolhope


# Session 1
In the first session of Woolhope, three eccentric villagers—spaghetti warlock Alfredo, vampire-thrall Kael, and amnesiac doctor Roy—serve the vampiric patron Rye Linguinius in a magically shielded village caught between warring factions, but their discovery of Arfer, a soldier marked by Rye’s rival the Red Archon, sets off a chaotic chain of events including botched healing, divine warnings, and the kidnapping of village elder Aynuk in a desperate attempt to conceal Arfer’s identity before outside forces arrive.
