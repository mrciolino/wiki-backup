# Woolhope

In the magically-shielded village of Woolhope, three eccentric thrallsâ€”**Alfredo Fettuccini** the spaghetti warlock, **Kael Virethorn** the vampire spawn, and **Roy** the hemophobic amnesiac doctorâ€”serve their vampiric patron **Rilinguineas** in a settlement caught between warring religious factions. Their precarious existence shatters when **Arfer**, a wounded soldier marked by the Red Archon, breaches their barrier, forcing the trio into a desperate conspiracy of kidnapping, disguise, and deception. As representatives from the militant **Wegateians** and the infernal **Narasians** arrive for a supposed neutrality dinner, the party's chaotic incompetenceâ€”from poisoning guests with holy apples to serving blood wine to bird clericsâ€”unravels their master's secret allegiances and culminates in betrayal, death, and the fall of their sanctuary.

## Set and Setting

South-West of Wardson Tower in [Felldun](/locations/Mardun/Felldun) near the border of [Wyrmford](/locations/Mardun/Wyrmford). This adventure takes place around 110 AC in the village of **Woolhope**, a settlement protected by a pinkish magical barrier that shields it from the Soul Torn monsters roaming the surrounding wasteland. The village exists in a precarious state of declared neutrality between the warring Wegateian and Narasian factions, though this neutrality proves to be a carefully maintained facade.

## Key Locations

- **Woolhope Village**: A small settlement within a magical barrier, featuring Alfredo's restaurant, Rilinguineas' manor, and various farms including Mikhail's sheep operation
- **The Barrier's Edge**: The boundary between safety and the monster-infested wasteland where Soul Torn creatures patrol
- **The Restaurant**: The primary setting for the climactic diplomatic dinner, complete with kitchen storage where Arfer was hidden

## Major NPCs

- **Rilinguineas (Rye Linguinius)**: The vampire lord patron of Woolhope, secretly allied with the Narasians despite claiming neutrality
- **Arfer**: A wounded Narasian soldier bearing the Red Archon's mark, whose presence threatened to expose the village's true allegiances
- **Vanaya**: A succubus serving as the Narasian delegate, revealed to have corrupted Rilinguineas
- **Zafera** (Michelle): An owlin cleric representing the Wegateian delegation, worshipper of Spooops
- **Aynuk**: The village elder, kidnapped by the party to facilitate Arfer's disguise
- **The Red Archon**: A powerful entity whose mark on Arfer suggested deeper supernatural conflicts

    ðŸ“– <strong>Session 2 - The Cover Up</strong> ðŸ“– 

In the second session of Woolhope, the trio's desperate plan spirals into chaos as Alfredo investigates a bloody rag at the shepherd's farm and becomes convinced of murder, Roy and Kael botch multiple escape attempts through windowsâ€”resulting in bruised bodies and bruised egosâ€”and their hostage Aynuk surprisingly cooperates as they prepare a reckless disguise for Arfer using stolen shears and vampire makeup, only for tensions to skyrocket when both warring factions' delegates arrive separately for a neutrality dinner, forcing the party into improvised roles as restaurant staff while hiding a barely-concealed Arfer in the storage room and discovering unsettling clues about the supposedly dead shepherd's mysterious neck wound.

### **[Recap of Previous Session]**
The party - vampire spawn serving patron Rye Linguineas - discovered Arfer, a wounded Narasine soldier, near their magically shielded village of Wolhope. Recognizing his presence could disrupt impending peace negotiations between the warring Narasine and Wegation factions, they kidnapped village elder Ainuk to conceal Arfer's arrival. Their current plan involves disguising Arfer as Ainuk using his beard while hiding the real Ainuk. Alfredo went searching for sheep shears to facilitate the disguise while Kael and Roy transported Ainuk to Linguineas' manor.

**Unresolved Plot Threads:**
1. Will the beard disguise successfully fool village observers?
2. What consequences will come from kidnapping Ainuk?
3. Why was Arfer left untouched near the barrier?
4. What are the true intentions of the arriving diplomatic delegations?

Last session saw the trio attempting to hide soldier Arfer (bearing a suspicious red shoulder mark) from visiting delegations by disguising him as an elder, then ultimately stashing him in a kitchen closet. Their chaotic efforts included a three-story window jump and multiple falls, revealing Kael's forgotten spider-climbing abilities. As this session opens, the party prepares to serve dinner to the rival delegations: the Narasians (led by winged demon Venaia) and the Wegate delegation (including owlin cleric Zafera), while maintaining Arfer's concealment.

The party attempted to serve dinner while hiding Arfer. Alfredo struggled with missing ingredients, Roy failed to find garlic (discovering the golden apple instead), and Kael offended both delegations - serving deviled eggs to a bird-person and blood wine to the Wegate group. The golden apple crisps poisoned the undead Wegate members, while garlic in Rilinguineas' pasta nearly killed him.

**2. Poison Aftermath (1/3 session)**

</details>


## Impact and Discoveries

The Woolhope campaign revealed the devastating consequences of incompetence in high-stakes diplomacy. Key discoveries included:

- **Political Betrayal**: Woolhope's supposed neutrality was a lieâ€”Rilinguineas had been corrupted by Narasian agents
- **Religious Warfare**: The conflict between Wegateians and Narasians involved undead forces and divine magic, with holy items proving lethal to undead delegates
- **Supernatural Corruption**: The influence of entities like the Red Archon and succubi like Vanaya demonstrated the otherworldly nature of the faction conflict
- **The Cost of Loyalty**: Alfredo's final stand, choosing customer service over patron loyalty, highlighted themes of principle versus survival

The campaign concluded with Woolhope's fall to the Narasians, Alfredo's heroic death defending the fleeing Wegateian delegates, and the survivors (Kael and Roy) fleeing into the dangerous wastelandâ€”their actions having inadvertently exposed a crucial strategic deception in the larger war.
