    ðŸ“– <strong>Session 1</strong> ðŸ“– 

In the first session of Woolhope, three eccentric villagersâ€”spaghetti warlock Alfredo, vampire-thrall Kael, and amnesiac doctor Royâ€”serve the vampiric patron Rye Linguinius in a magically shielded village caught between warring factions, but their discovery of Arfer, a soldier marked by Ryeâ€™s rival the Red Archon, sets off a chaotic chain of events including botched healing, divine warnings, and the kidnapping of village elder Aynuk in a desperate attempt to conceal Arferâ€™s identity before outside forces arrive.
