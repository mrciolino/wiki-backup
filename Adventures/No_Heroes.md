## Overview
"no heroes" was set in the gulf of fywick's western bank at the ruins of an ancient cyclopean port, now known as redwater port. Krorgfrey, the golden lord of Fywick New Geskoworm traveled there with his dragon knight entourage to seize the hidden secrets in the dungeon under the city, but got assassinated by dark forces who also killed the rest of the dragon knights. The Shattered Eyes clan operates somewhere in the celestial vale, and the silverwinds faction come from the north banks of Champion's Cup.
