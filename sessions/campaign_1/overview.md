## Session 1
###### January 8, 2020

Battle ensued in the tavern as a demon rampaged through [Pope's Pub](/locations/Mardun/Popes-Pub), but our "Gallant" and "Trustworthy" and "Heroic" "Heroes" "Killed" the demon and then "Peacefully" left following [Freedom](/characters/freedom), a magical escaped robot slave hell-bent on freeing all the other enslaved robots. After failing his revolution to get the guards' help, he then paid our "Heroes" to clear the valuable mines of [Fort Suro](/locations/Mardun/Fort-Suro).

At the same time, however, [Otto Herzog](/characters/otto-herzog) had a "faked" "bounty" on [Os Vrntica](/characters/os-vrntica) and nearly killed him. He would have died if not for [Freedom](/characters/freedom).

During the Demon Battle in the pub, [Spoops](/characters/spoops) "seduced" and "gained" the "love" and "affection" of a powerful demon and "sent" him back to the abyss, all without learning his name.

[Drakham](/characters/drakham) and [Seriphi](/characters/seriphi) questioned the demon if he was their father. They gained no evidence from him, and so their search continues.

[Frederina](/characters/frederina) lost a dagger and forgot to go back to get it at the pub.

[Peter's character](/characters/peter) proved himself to be a shit thief and "almost" a "traitor" to the team by healing the demon. After that, "anyway so I started blasting," and the demon was "finished" by [Spoops](/characters/spoops), though he did gain a lot of booze.

[Os Vrntica](/characters/os-vrntica) "apparently" has a "bounty" placed on his head and ultimately doesn't know if he is safe with [Otto Herzog](/characters/otto-herzog).

[Kiwi](/characters/kiwi): "YOU'RE NOT MY DAD!"

[Brazzart](/characters/brazzart) got his ass kicked by the guards, then was saved by [Freedom](/characters/freedom). May he live long and do something of importance.

Will anyone remember that they were called to the pub for an unknown reason by an unknown coordinator, or will they follow [Freedom](/characters/freedom) on a revolution for freedom?

Who knows? Next time on **Low Bar Brawlers**. The bar gets lowered.

## Session 2
###### January 15, 2020

Our heroes woke up rested in the basement of the [Fort Suro](/locations/Mardun/Fort-Suro) guard barracks, but [Drakham](/characters/drakham) was chained up as the guards were convinced he summoned the demon in [Pope's Pub](/locations/Mardun/Popes-Pub). Our heroes went up to confront the captain of the guards and then instantly tried to steal and beg him for money and equipment. After getting 3.50 and three daggers, they pissed off the captain and left shortly afterward. They explored [Fort Suro](/locations/Mardun/Fort-Suro), but after that quick look around, they went deep into the mines and are fighting for their lives, surrounded and besieged by a whole den full of goblins and their wolves. Will they survive? Will they help [Freedom](/characters/freedom)? Why is [Gilthur](/characters/gilthur) starting to hulk out? These questions answered next time in **Low Bar Brawlers**!

---

## Session 3 - WTF <a id='Session 3 - WTF'></a>
###### January 22, 2020

I'm dispensing with the story.

The battle continued. Goblins died; one was captured and investigated.

A bear was found guarding treasure and was suplexed into a treasure chest to contain it.

The goblin boss came with a badger and a cannon and killed [Os Vrntica](/characters/os-vrntica).

But like the fucking gambler he is, [Drakham](/characters/drakham) used his Tides of Chaos to get himself back up from death and fucked with the winds of magic, reincarnating [Os Vrntica](/characters/os-vrntica) back into a high elf.

Look, it's 11:53 PM, and I just can't even with the bad luck of 3 consecutive ones, which led to 2 people dying, and then 3 consecutive crit 20s to bring everyone back to life.

---

## Session 4 - Guardison <a id='Session 4 - Guardison'></a>
###### January 29, 2020

So, with the goblins defeated and their spoils looted, the party collects their rewards from Captain [Guardison](/characters/guardison) in the [Fort Suro](/locations/Mardun/Fort-Suro) barracks. After narrowly deciding against violence, our brave few go and join a caravan as an escort. But before they take off in the morning, they sleep in [Pope's Pub](/locations/Mardun/Popes-Pub) for free, and [Otto Herzog](/characters/otto-herzog) is disturbed out of his sleep by...

![Image of pickle]

After waking a couple of other people, the party talks with the ghostly pickle and gains from it a clue of [Spoops](/characters/spoops)' past and that the truth of the matter lies with [Guardison Sr.](/characters/guardison-sr) in [Trelston](/locations/Trelston).

After that, in the morning, they move out with the caravan and run into highwaymen. Instead of fighting them, our heroic party tries to pay the toll by entertaining [Balk](/characters/balk) and his crew of ne'er-do-wells. Not only do they succeed, but [Otto Herzog](/characters/otto-herzog) and [Drakham](/characters/drakham) steal 250 Gold and 5 Grenades. [Balk](/characters/balk) enjoys the performance so much that he gives a standing ovation and allows our team and the caravan to go unmolested.

Thus bringing all of them to [Trelston](/locations/Trelston), a smaller coastal town where [Guardison Sr.](/characters/guardison-sr) lives with the rest of the [Guardison](/characters/guardison) family. The first stop on the caravan route, next stop [Kaltrosar Bay](/locations/Kaltrosar-Bay).

[Bazzert](/characters/bazzert), [Drakham](/characters/drakham), and [Frederina](/characters/frederina) happen upon very hostile bridges but weather their assault and get to the lighthouse, where they meet [Guardison Sr.](/characters/guardison-sr) and then start leading him to [Spoops](/characters/spoops) and the rest of the party.

But right before [Guardison Sr.](/characters/guardison-sr) can meet the team, [Drakham](/characters/drakham)'s uncontrollable powers of the magic weave have acted strangely, and now his magic is cursed.

**NEXT TIME:** Will [Drakham](/characters/drakham)'s magic cause chaos and misery? Will [Guardison Sr.](/characters/guardison-sr) give [Spoops](/characters/spoops) the answers he's looking for? Will [Seriphi](/characters/seriphi) ever become involved with the story and combat again?

ALL OF THIS ANSWERED NEXT TIME ON...

**LOW BAR BRAWLERS**

## Session 5 - Badger Badger Badger
###### February 5, 2020

1. [Frederina](/characters/frederina) met her Warlock patron, a giant faceless tentacled thing, which she now serves.

2. [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) almost started a fight with the locals over them not having a magic staff for him to buy.

3. [Drakham](/characters/drakham)'s magic was still Eff'd, so he was just doing random spell effects and clutching things.

4. The gang went to the barkeep [Guardison Sr.](/characters/guardison-sr) talked about and absolutely freaked him out, chased him around town, but got him to give up the info [Spoops](/characters/spoops) needed.

5. [Spoops](/characters/spoops) met [Guardison Sr.](/characters/guardison-sr), then tried to kidnap him, then rob him, and then desecrated a shrine (he was a chaotic good paladin) for a magic necklace, which had no importance in the grand scheme of things.

6. Said desecration caused a swarm of badgers to attack the group.

7. Box Bear was befriended and tamed by [Os Vrntica](/characters/os-vrntica), then [Krorg](/characters/krorg).

8. [Frederina](/characters/frederina) set the forest ablaze, and after 20 minutes, [Kiwi](/characters/kiwi) took it upon himself to get people to help the guards put out the fire.

9. Box Bear joined the group and was named [Bomb the Bear](/characters/bomb-the-bear).

10. Next session will leave the small fishing village of [Trelston](/locations/Trelston).

11. Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger.

12. **WILL OUR HEROES GAIN CONTROL OF THEIR RENEGADE FRIENDS? WILL THEIR ORIGINAL PURPOSE FOR GATHERING IN [FORT SURO](/locations/Mardun/Fort-Suro) EVER BE REVEALED? WILL NEXT SESSION INVOLVE PIRATES?** ALL OF THIS ANSWERED NEXT TIME ON...

**Comments:**

WTF ever happened to [Freedom](/characters/freedom) and the robot slaves? Did we just fuck off because they weren't paying us?

## My God It Went So WRONG
###### February 12, 2020

First, [Krorg](/characters/krorg) dressed up [Bomb the Bear](/characters/bomb-the-bear) to disguise him and get him into human places.

Then the group heads to [Kaltrosar Bay](/locations/Kaltrosar-Bay), gets paid, and looks for more work.

They go to the castle looking for work, but it doesn't work because [Krorg](/characters/krorg) brought a bear. Then they head to the Merchant's Guild and get a job to clear out the sewers of [Kaltrosar Bay](/locations/Kaltrosar-Bay).

All this while, [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) transformed into a squirrel and infiltrated the castle.

[Drakham](/characters/drakham) and [Krorg](/characters/krorg) get inside the castle with [Otto Herzog](/characters/otto-herzog) and [Frederina](/characters/frederina).

[Frederina](/characters/frederina) gets arrested for touching the soft hands of the Prince of [Kaltrosar Bay](/locations/Kaltrosar-Bay).

[Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) screws up his disguise and gets led to the dungeon.

[Krorg](/characters/krorg), [Drakham](/characters/drakham), and [Otto Herzog](/characters/otto-herzog) get a lieutenant of the guards to lead them to the sewer access in the castle's dungeon, meeting up with [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) and [Frederina](/characters/frederina).

[Drakham](/characters/drakham) tries valiantly to unfuck the situation by persuading the guards that they're here to check the security of the castle, and they fail by letting them in. They don't buy it.

The group gives in and is arrested. Then [Drakham](/characters/drakham) accidentally kills Lord [Barrymoore](/characters/barrymoore) in one hit.

Then more guards straight from the King of [Kaltrosar Bay](/locations/Kaltrosar-Bay). [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) angers the guards, and they try to kill [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert), so combat ensues.

After fighting through a large meaty man, the group frees themselves and [Freedom](/characters/freedom), gets their stuff back, and [Freedom](/characters/freedom) sets fire to the castle. As the group escapes, they gather [Os Vrntica](/characters/os-vrntica), [Seriphi](/characters/seriphi), [Spoops](/characters/spoops), and [Kiwi](/characters/kiwi) and escape.

They escaped by distracting dock workers with free beer and by [Freedom](/characters/freedom) setting fire to the dock. Everyone stowed away in cargo crates and got on a ship leaving [Kaltrosar Bay](/locations/Kaltrosar-Bay).

**What will happen next time?** Because I don't fucking even know, and I'm the DM.

**Comments:**

You forgot the impending bear war because the king hates bears.

## Boats and Hoes
###### February 19, 2020

You all woke up on a trading ship.

Started a bidding war with the captain for voyage on his ship and tried to kill him, but at the same time, the ship is attacked by Orcish pirates.

You all team up to fight the pirates, and [Os Vrntica](/characters/os-vrntica) woke up [Freedom](/characters/freedom), who came up and finished off the pirates on the boat.

As the ship crew fights off the pirate ship, [Krorg](/characters/krorg) fights [Freedom](/characters/freedom) with [Bomb the Bear](/characters/bomb-the-bear) and with a cannon. He hit [Freedom](/characters/freedom) and punched a hole through the ship.

[Drakham](/characters/drakham) and [Os Vrntica](/characters/os-vrntica) tried to stop the fighting but failed.

After some fighting, a Dragon Turtle shows up and attacks the trading ship and the pirate ships.

[Freedom](/characters/freedom) then jumped onto the Dragon Turtle, and [Krorg](/characters/krorg) followed. They drove the Dragon Turtle into the pirate fleet, wrecking them.

The rest of the gang now heads off to [Allford](/locations/Allford) with the Captain and his ship.

**Comments:**

All of the pirates are dead, and the fighting is over. After witnessing (and accidentally causing) [Freedom](/characters/freedom)'s genocidal behavior in [Kaltrosar Bay](/locations/Kaltrosar-Bay), fearing [Freedom](/characters/freedom) would attract the attention of vengeful armies, and being a general Luddite, [Krorg](/characters/krorg) decides to use the opportunity to eliminate [Freedom](/characters/freedom). [Os Vrntica](/characters/os-vrntica) and [Drakham](/characters/drakham) both try to stop the fighting, but [Krorg](/characters/krorg) is set in his belief that [Freedom](/characters/freedom) is a dangerous weapon that the **Low Bar Brawlers** have only begun to abuse. [Os Vrntica](/characters/os-vrntica) issues an order to [Freedom](/characters/freedom) not to kill anyone in the party and to destroy the remaining pirate ships. Seconds later, [Krorg](/characters/krorg) starts blasting.

The first shot knocks [Freedom](/characters/freedom) deep into the ship before [Drakham](/characters/drakham) casts Reduce on the size of the cannon. Hearing [Freedom](/characters/freedom) moving below, [Krorg](/characters/krorg) and [Bomb the Bear](/characters/bomb-the-bear) decide to gain the high ground in the fight by climbing the ship's mast. [Drakham](/characters/drakham) successfully charms [Krorg](/characters/krorg) to climb back down to the deck. [Krorg](/characters/krorg) agrees to surrender, but his sudden change in nature causes him to be bitten by [Bomb the Bear](/characters/bomb-the-bear), ending the spell. Off the side of the ship, [Freedom](/characters/freedom) appears while riding a large Dragon Turtle, about to head off to destroy the remaining pirate ships. [Krorg](/characters/krorg) thanks [Bomb the Bear](/characters/bomb-the-bear) for saving him and decides to leave [Bomb the Bear](/characters/bomb-the-bear) behind to the safety of the **Low Bar Brawlers**. Then [Krorg](/characters/krorg) runs and dives off of the mast into the water, catching the Dragon Turtle's tail before being dragged off into the horizon...

---

## Hello Allford
###### February 26, 2020

We get back after the pirate fight and after [Freedom](/characters/freedom) and [Krorg](/characters/krorg) jump onto a Dragon Turtle.

The ship is still hectic, and the crew and some of the gang help out by repairing what they can and fishing up some fish for more food on the voyage to [Allford](/locations/Allford).

After some "hole" fixing shenanigans, [Os Vrntica](/characters/os-vrntica) confronts the Elven taskmaster of the ship, and in fact, it's his cousin [Eugene Vrntica](/characters/eugene-vrntica), though only noticing this after a short musical battle between the two.

Then after a three-day voyage, the gang gets to [Allford](/locations/Allford) and immediately gets referred to [The West Sorea Trading Company](/organizations/west-sorea-trading-company) for more work from Captain [John Robin](/characters/john-robin) of the Seabird. But as immediately as that, [Otto Herzog](/characters/otto-herzog) and [Frederina](/characters/frederina) were pickpocketed, and they were out to get their money back.

After [Kiwi](/characters/kiwi) read some thieves' cant, they saw the thief head to the park and down a cave entrance. Then [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) almost set the park on fire as he produced flames while inside a bush.

The gang, of course, put out the fire by urinating on a bear rug and throwing it upon the burning bush.

[Drakham](/characters/drakham) is first, however, in finding the thief and sneaks up on him, scaring the pickpocket. The corrupt guards in the thief tunnel get the guards to point them in the direction of the thief.

Down the sewer they went, and through it all, they all got covered in excrement. [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) almost killed himself and [Drakham](/characters/drakham) with more fire in a cloud of methane above a pool of poop.

After everyone getting covered in crap, they found a small entrance staircase leading down and found themselves in tight corridors fighting spiders and zombies in trap-filled hallways.

**What is next for our "Stalwart" adventurers?** More ASS? More GAS? More EXPLOSIONS?

Next time on **Low Bar Brawlers**!

---

## Session 9 - Dungeon Trekking
###### March 4, 2020

So we pick up right with [Spoops](/characters/spoops) exploring [Allford](/locations/Allford) and seems to piss off everyone. He learns that the undead are hated because of a decades-long conflict that ended 25 years ago called the **Necrotic Wars**, and that to this day, people hate the undead.

All of this as [Drakham](/characters/drakham) and [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) are cornered by a pack of spiders, and [Drakham](/characters/drakham) just annihilates them with his magical abilities.

Then the party finds the lost halfling pickpocket and drags him along through hallways of trap-filled, skeleton-filled danger.

[Os Vrntica](/characters/os-vrntica) follows up this excitement with a calming ballad, which reinvigorates the party and prepares them for the rest of the dungeon, the likes of which are filled with a gelatinous cube, more spiders, and a Wall of Fire.

The gang found a mysterious wall of fire and weird paintings that light up with proper activation, but before figuring out the mystery, they have to deal with a mimic.

And then **BOOM**, in from the outside and out of nowhere, [Krorg](/characters/krorg) re-enters the fray with a pirate crew with one goal: to kill [Freedom](/characters/freedom).

After some introductions and re-introductions, [Krorg](/characters/krorg)'s crew dispels the wall of fire and is ready to move on to the dungeon exit.

**What's up next?** More spiders? [Freedom](/characters/freedom)? Kung Pow Chicken with a side of rice?

Who knows? Next Time on **Low Bar Brawlers**.

---
## Shitty Pirate Revelations
###### March 11 2020

We pick back up in the [Sewers](/locations/allford-sewers) where [Krorg](/characters/krorg) has just reunited with the party, and has a pirate crew accompanying him. This pirate crew came together after the pirate boarding at sea gone wrong as [Krorg](/characters/krorg) ended up marooned on shore with [Nathar](/characters/nathar) and looking to kill [Freedom](/characters/freedom). They met with the [Pirate King](/characters/pirate-king) and added [Dave Bones](/characters/dave-bones), [Darfalle](/characters/darfalle), and [Xialethia](/characters/xialethia) to the [Freedom](/characters/freedom) kill team. They followed [Freedom](/characters/freedom) and found his clues pointing to [Illiard Tower](/locations/illiard-tower) in [Allford](/locations/allford). They burst into the city sewers to enter the tower at its weakest point to avoid the defenses [Freedom](/characters/freedom) would put up, little did they know the defenses they were avoiding didn't exist and they were heading for a trap. Luckily they ran into the rest of the party who happened to be in the same sewer system. After reuniting, [Krorg](/characters/krorg) had his new crew dispel the firewall, and the group moves forward and searches the next room only to find gibbets filled with corpses.

[Spoops](/characters/spoops) checks out the nearby bedroom while [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) goes back to search some unexplored rooms and finds more cobwebs and spider egg clutches, but leaves as he hears ominous scuttling noises. Soon after, the pickpocket that was confronted in the sewers was torn to shreds by some unknown creature, and the group left him to his fate.

After some searching, [Spoops](/characters/spoops) and [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) find a book and unlock the ability to unlock and lock a certain door. [Krorg](/characters/krorg) blocks the path behind the party while [Spoops](/characters/spoops) opens up to see a woman surrounded by Four Skeletal Ogres. She unleashes the Ogres and a Storm of fireballs at the party, but with luck and perseverance, the party weathers the storm and defeats the evil necrotic wizard.

This was only the prelude as soon things will go off the rails. The party navigates some very dangerous fireball traps and another pool of ****, only to find themselves at the bottom of a deep 35ft pit with some random trash being dropped on them.

After confronting the trash dropper and finding it to be [Lucidel Illiard](/characters/lucidel-illiard) (Remember him, kids, he'll be important), owner of [Illiard Tower](/locations/illiard-tower) and a Merchant Lord of [Allford](/locations/allford). After helping our party out of the hole, he introduces himself and tells our would-be heroes that [Freedom](/characters/freedom) is in the other room. [Freedom](/characters/freedom) arrives after being called, seeming to be beat up and a bit waterlogged. Either way, though, he is confronted by [Dave Bones](/characters/dave-bones) and the other pirates plus [Krorg](/characters/krorg). [Dave Bones](/characters/dave-bones) pulls out an ancient magic jar, [The Hendrica Capsule](/items/hendrica-capsule), and sucks the soul out of [Freedom](/characters/freedom). Everyone looked on as red ominous demonic tendrils lash from the robotic frame to the insides of the jar and are sealed by [Dave Bones](/characters/dave-bones). [Freedom](/characters/freedom)'s body goes limp and falls to the floor.

With their business done, the pirates start to leave, but [Nathar](/characters/nathar) confronts the rest and says that he is there to kill [Freedom](/characters/freedom) for destroying his ships at sea. [Dave Bones](/characters/dave-bones) replies with, "If ya here for death, then I'll give it to ya!" and shanks [Nathar](/characters/nathar) in the neck. [Nathar](/characters/nathar) falls, bleeding and dying instantly.

After such an unexpected and grizzly scene, [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) asks [Lucidel Illiard](/characters/lucidel-illiard) if he can read him a book, and [Spoops](/characters/spoops) asks for help trying to get a giant spider to hatch from a spider egg so it can be his pet.

Utter psychotic levels of emotional awareness being shown only forced [Lucidel Illiard](/characters/lucidel-illiard) to notice the glow from [Spoops](/characters/spoops)' pants (No, this is not getting sexual). [Lucidel Illiard](/characters/lucidel-illiard) asks [Spoops](/characters/spoops) if he has any magic items in his pocket. [Spoops](/characters/spoops) reveals the demonic stone that he got from his Demon Boytoy from the [Fort Suro Bar](/locations/fort-suro-bar). [Lucidel Illiard](/characters/lucidel-illiard) then reveals the stone's true nature—a soul prison—and he releases the soul within it, which flows back into [Freedom](/characters/freedom)'s body, and from this rises [Freedom](/characters/freedom). [Lucidel Illiard](/characters/lucidel-illiard) explains that when the Demon was covered in booze, bleeding, and dying, that when [Spoops](/characters/spoops) killed him, he actually had helped finish a demon ritual that trapped [Freedom](/characters/freedom)'s soul in the stone [Spoops](/characters/spoops) has been holding all this time and put the Demon into [Freedom](/characters/freedom)'s body. Now with [Freedom](/characters/freedom) restored, the truth revealed, and the Party having met [Lucidel Illiard](/characters/lucidel-illiard), he asks them if they've been to [Fort Suro](/locations/fort-suro). They respond yes, and [Lucidel Illiard](/characters/lucidel-illiard) says that he has a job for them.

What will the pirates do with a Demon Soul?

Is [Freedom](/characters/freedom) fully restored?

What is the job [Lucidel Illiard](/characters/lucidel-illiard) offered?

Will [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) ever read his book?

Will [Krorg](/characters/krorg) avenge [Nathar](/characters/nathar)?

Who is [Darmuth](/characters/darmuth) and why does [Drakham](/characters/drakham) know his name?

ALL OF THIS NEXT TIME IN **LOW BAR BRAWLERS**

## Leaving Allford
###### March 18 2020

So we return to our heroes after the [Freedom](/characters/freedom) soul switcher conundrum, and [Krorg](/characters/krorg) interrogates [Os Vrntica](/characters/os-vrntica) about him being demonic/demon sympathizer. He does this by hiding his lute and then holding him over a pit.

In the morning, everyone awakes to find [Lucidel Illiard](/characters/lucidel-illiard) by some test tubes with bone spider carcasses on display, and he gives the party a job to investigate and deal with a cult in the [Ghostwood Forest](/locations/ghostwood-forest) near [Demsford](/locations/demsford), a small village. The party is told that they have a lot of authority in deciding how to deal with the cult, as if they have an old necrotic war plague, the cult could destroy [Allford](/locations/allford). That is all the info that [Lucidel Illiard](/characters/lucidel-illiard) knows about the cult situation and sets our heroes out to solve it.

Our heroes head out and search for [Dave Bones](/characters/dave-bones) and his team to see if they can stop them and avenge [Nathar](/characters/nathar)/get the demon soul. Our heroes fail as [Krorg](/characters/krorg) remembers where their escape boat would be docked, but it was gone. However, in their time searching, [Kiwi](/characters/kiwi) found a useful informant called [Willey](/characters/willey), most likely a fence, but to keep it simple: he knows a guy. After paying [Willey](/characters/willey), the party learns more about the cult, and they may be powerful sorcerers or brainwashed simpletons worshiping a WMD.

Then everyone goes shopping, and the team gets a carriage drawn by two horses, turning the party's travel time from a week down to 5 days. With one day left, the party makes camp when entering the forest, as nighttime travel through the [Ghostwood Forest](/locations/ghostwood-forest) is dangerous and unadvised.

Everyone goes to sleep, but [Drakham](/characters/drakham) loses control of his powers and strikes himself and the horses with a lightning bolt, nearly killing himself and instantly killing the horses. Then [Frederina](/characters/frederina) is contacted by a large golden lobster that tells her to "join us." She ignores it, and [Krorg](/characters/krorg) goes after it, trying to catch it and eat it. [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) also goes after the lobster and turns into a slightly larger version of said lobster and starts fighting [Krorg](/characters/krorg). [Krorg](/characters/krorg) accidentally hits the original golden lobster, and he and [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) are pulled through a portal and transported in front of some sort of ancient shadow creature. It is unamused and banishes them from its sight. [Krorg](/characters/krorg) and [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) wake up in an underwater cave and hear the following: "So, you have arrived."

Who is this voice?

What was the creature in the portal?

Why lobsters?

Where did [Spoops](/characters/spoops), [Seiriphi](/characters/seiriphi), and [Otto Herzog](/characters/otto-herzog) go?

All of this answered next time on **LOW BAR BRAWLERS!**

###### March 26 2020

We come back to our heroes with [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) and [Krorg](/characters/krorg) in an underwater cave with [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert)'s master [Ayod](/characters/ayod). He has come to tell his estranged student [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) that some stars are disappearing from the sky, and he doesn't know why. Then [Ayod](/characters/ayod) helps train [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) to read the weird book.

[Krorg](/characters/krorg) resurfaces to see [Frederina](/characters/frederina) talking to a golden lobster. Upon closer inspection, she is entranced by it and doesn't notice [Krorg](/characters/krorg). [Os Vrntica](/characters/os-vrntica) and [Krorg](/characters/krorg) try to lift the lobster almost like a competition, but they both fail completely to lift said golden lobster. After all that and having their horses be inconveniently dead, [Bomb](/characters/bomb) and [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) (transformed into a bear) pull the carriage to [Demsford](/locations/demsford).

Four days prior, we get back to [Spoops](/characters/spoops) in [Allford](/locations/allford), strolling out of a bar, and he hears the voice of the lord, his God. [Spoops](/characters/spoops)' god says, "Get your shit together and ride north." [Spoops](/characters/spoops) then robs a man passing by of his horse and leaves him on the street and rides north out of [Allford](/locations/allford). He rides for 4 days and gets to [Demsford](/locations/demsford) first and then immediately goes to the bar and drinks.

The rest of the team shows up, and on their way into the village, they are greeted with desiccated corpses strung up on crosses; these were some of the villagers. The team then immediately sees an orphan boy and talks to him. His name is [Teddy](/characters/teddy), and his parents were killed by the cult. Our heroes then go to the bar, [Spoops](/characters/spoops) rejoins the group, and they rally the villagers to kick the cult out of town. At the head of this mob, every cultist our heroes find is cut down except for one, as he will be used to lead the team to the cultist fortress.

After a couple of hours trekking through the woods, they come just outside the fortress, and the team runs into a patrol. One of the patrol cultists runs up into sight of the other cultists and then is turned into a pile of goo by [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert)'s acid arrow. [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) would repeat this trick on their guide cultist, as ya know, no loose ends and all that stuff. Now, however, loose ends are not the focus as there is an entire fortress of cultists to fight.

[Krorg](/characters/krorg) and [Bomb](/characters/bomb) mount the battlements and start slaughtering the cultists. [Os Vrntica](/characters/os-vrntica) and [Spoops](/characters/spoops) charge the front gate while on horseback, taking out a couple but sustaining major damage. [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) and [Drakham](/characters/drakham) do a couple of things like arguing and turning into gas, but besides that, not a whole lot. The battle quickly turns, however, as every cultist comes over to fight the would-be defilers (the team). [Krorg](/characters/krorg) and [Bomb](/characters/bomb) get pinned down by a crossbow and magic barrage, and the rest of the team is following...

**THE DRAKHAM PLAN**

So the plan is to retreat and wait until the cultists aren't alert and then break in by making holes in their wall and kill them all group by group instead of a frontal assault against all of them at once.

Little does [Drakham](/characters/drakham) know, the cult fortress already has holes in its walls, and [Krorg](/characters/krorg) and [Bomb](/characters/bomb) would eventually die if left alone to fight all the cultists by themselves. So instead, they follow...

**THE SECOND DRAKHAM PLAN**

So this plan is to ride around the side of the fortress and flank the cultists on horseback like a mini cavalry charge and save [Krorg](/characters/krorg) and [Bomb](/characters/bomb).

This plan, while a bit better, also failed as one of the cultists ran to get his boss. During the time before the cultist boss shows up, [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) is attacked by the fortress firing squad and gets struck by crossbow bolts and fire bolts and falls unconscious in a burning tree. Good thing [Frederina](/characters/frederina) stopped the flames from burning [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) alive and pulled him from the tree. But then...

**VEERIAN RATHWING ARRIVES**

(Dark souls boss fight music intensifies)

![Token image of Rathwing](/characters/other/wrath.png =250x)

[Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) now, however, is pulling a lot of weight and starts obliterating the cultists with lightning and moonbeams, thinning out the firing squad targeting [Krorg](/characters/krorg) and [Bomb](/characters/bomb). But [Krorg](/characters/krorg) and [Bomb](/characters/bomb) have bigger issues now as [Veerian Rathwing](/characters/veerian-rathwing) animates 5 gold coins from his pocket and sends them to attack [Bomb](/characters/bomb). The coins brutalize [Bomb](/characters/bomb), and [Bomb](/characters/bomb) falls unconscious after a tiring fight, being pin-cushioned by cultist crossbows, burned by firebolts, and now he succumbs to the coins. Everyone now focuses on [Veerian Rathwing](/characters/veerian-rathwing) as the cultists are all dead but for two, and those two decide to run rather than die. In the ensuing battle, [Krorg](/characters/krorg) throws his trident into the side of [Veerian Rathwing](/characters/veerian-rathwing) and then pulls [Veerian Rathwing](/characters/veerian-rathwing) from the air down over the fortress walls. The rest of the team closes in for the kill, but [Veerian Rathwing](/characters/veerian-rathwing) goes invisible and attacks the team from the shadows. A fireball strikes [Spoops](/characters/spoops) and [Drakham](/characters/drakham), causing [Drakham](/characters/drakham) to fall, but [Spoops](/characters/spoops) gives chase toward the direction of the attack. [Veerian Rathwing](/characters/veerian-rathwing) fails to blind [Spoops](/characters/spoops), and he casts detect good and evil, now seeing [Veerian Rathwing](/characters/veerian-rathwing)'s evil aura.

But then...

**Bomb the Bear Dies**

[Image of tombstone reading RIP Bomb with token image of Bomb]

This happens unbeknownst to [Krorg](/characters/krorg), and so he breaks two of the five animated gold coins on his way to [Drakham](/characters/drakham), who is dying on the ground. [Spoops](/characters/spoops) continues to battle an invisible [Veerian Rathwing](/characters/veerian-rathwing), and [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) attacks [Veerian Rathwing](/characters/veerian-rathwing) with his Moonbeam but also scorches [Spoops](/characters/spoops) with the holy moonfire, causing [Spoops](/characters/spoops) to fall unconscious. [Krorg](/characters/krorg) helps [Drakham](/characters/drakham), and [Drakham](/characters/drakham) pulls out some wild magic and absorbs the life force of the animated coins and some of [Krorg](/characters/krorg)'s and rises from near death like a phoenix. Quickly after this, though, [Veerian Rathwing](/characters/veerian-rathwing) disengages from the fight and says, "You are all vermin who aren't worth my time, and these peasants are useless. I've already got what I wanted. Au revoir." [Veerian Rathwing](/characters/veerian-rathwing) disappears, and moments later, [Krorg](/characters/krorg) sees him flying away westward over the hills and trees.

[Krorg](/characters/krorg) now goes back to [Bomb](/characters/bomb) and discovers that [Bomb](/characters/bomb) is dead. He and [Drakham](/characters/drakham) are greatly saddened by this loss and move him to the riverside to bury him. Meanwhile, [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) decides to try and decipher his book and is able to just read the first line in the book...

**HOW TO KILL GODS**

What the fuck is this book?

Is [Bomb](/characters/bomb) really dead?

Where did [Veerian Rathwing](/characters/veerian-rathwing) run off to hide?

Why are stars disappearing from the night sky?

SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS ANSWERED NEXT TIME IN...

**LOW BAR BRAWLERS**

## Session 13 Grief and Shopping
###### March 29 2020

We return after the fight with the cultists, and [Bomb the Bear](/characters/bomb) is dead. [Drakham](/characters/drakham) and [Spoops](/characters/spoops) are arguing over what to do with [Bomb](/characters/bomb) as [Krorg](/characters/krorg) sleeps. They enter into a Mexican standoff, [Drakham](/characters/drakham) clutching his last grenade and [Spoops](/characters/spoops) with rope threatening to take [Bomb](/characters/bomb)'s corpse. Eventually, [Krorg](/characters/krorg) wakes up and decides to bury [Bomb](/characters/bomb). [Spoops](/characters/spoops) goes along as he was charmed by [Drakham](/characters/drakham). [Drakham](/characters/drakham) used a patch from his cloak to excavate a 10 by 10 by 10ft hole to bury [Bomb](/characters/bomb), and after some kind words, the group buries [Bomb](/characters/bomb) with the cultists. But there were too many cultists for the hole, and so you guys burned the corpses and then finished the burial. After the funeral, you return back to the mission at hand to search for artifacts and weapons belonging to the old Liches of the necrotic wars. Along the way, [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) finds a cool-looking gem and gathers a bunch of random ingredients that aren't that suspicious for a druid to gather but did so in a suspicious manner and has up to this point, the morning after the session, hasn't yet told me, the DM, what he plans to do with it, so I'll keep my eye on him.

Our heroes, however, find excavated areas in the fortress and with that, a chest contaminated with a green glowing liquid. All the vials are broken except one half-filled vial. [Drakham](/characters/drakham) and [Spoops](/characters/spoops) then conduct some "experiments" on the liquid, combining it with holy water, spit, seeing if it's flammable, and taking contaminated dirt and dumping it into a freshly made grave. The green liquid sizzles away from the holy water, just combines with spit, is very flammable, and we'll get back to the grave "experiment" later.

The team searches a tower on the east side of the ruined fortress and finds a pentagram symbol and a flayed body stabbed with a demonic dagger. [Spoops](/characters/spoops) decides to be cautious and throws a dagger into the body in the pentagram. Then [Krorg](/characters/krorg) takes the arcane focuses he got from the cultist wizards and places them at the points in the pentagram star. This causes the body to float and start screaming. The team tries to disguise themselves as cultists—no effect. They try to break the ritual—not effective. [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) uses the cursed horn, and the screaming corpse starts playing demonic music. After a while, the team pulls out the daggers from the corpse's chest, and it speaks to them. He is the protector of the poisons in the fortress and tells the team what he can. Then, after trying to free his soul or at least learn how, the team just breaks the pentagram ritual and starts to leave the fortress. As they cross the bridge over the river, they are attacked by a giant bone spider coming from their freshly dug grave. In the battle, [Drakham](/characters/drakham) and [Krorg](/characters/krorg) nearly die, but [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) and [Spoops](/characters/spoops) defeat the abomination. Then they depart to return to [Demsford](/locations/demsford).

The team returns to [Demsford](/locations/demsford) at night and finds it abandoned with no signs of people or life. Then the team remembers [Teddy](/characters/teddy) and starts to look for him, but alas, can't find anyone in the town. So they head up to the cultist temple on the hill and find a lot of corpses strung up on crosses and half-mutated with disgusting bone appendages sticking out of them and twitching, but no sign of [Teddy](/characters/teddy). Everyone heads back to the inn and starts to pack up and leave as [Spoops](/characters/spoops) contacted his God [Ryan](/characters/ryan) and said it's time to leave. As the rest of the team prep the horse and carriage, [Krorg](/characters/krorg) goes back up to the temple and takes one last look for [Teddy](/characters/teddy) and finds the Temple barred from the inside and decides to just leave. Our heroes leave [Demsford](/locations/demsford) and head back to [Allford](/locations/allford).

Back in [Allford](/locations/allford), they go to see [Lucidel Illiard](/characters/lucidel-illiard) and then get informed by his secretary that [Lucidel Illiard](/characters/lucidel-illiard) is meeting with the king, so they steal a document with an [Illiard](/characters/lucidel-illiard) seal on it and bluff their way into the castle. Our heroes are seated in a minor dining room in the castle and wait for [Lucidel Illiard](/characters/lucidel-illiard) to show up. During the 5 hours that they wait, [Krorg](/characters/krorg) and [Spoops](/characters/spoops) find a small girl playing under the stairs and play with her while they wait for [Lucidel Illiard](/characters/lucidel-illiard). [Lucidel Illiard](/characters/lucidel-illiard) shows up, and to keep this short, the team doesn't trust [Lucidel Illiard](/characters/lucidel-illiard). They try to discern his intentions, [Spoops](/characters/spoops) casts Zone of Truth, and gets him to say he just wants the Old Lich weapons/poisons so he can research them and be able to protect himself and [Allford](/locations/allford) in case they are attacked by such things in the future. The team has a green liquid vial but doesn't tell [Lucidel Illiard](/characters/lucidel-illiard) about it.

Then everyone goes shopping until 1am, and I start to break down a little as my mental faculties are assaulted by ineptitude, ignorance, and constant and unceasing haggling attempts. [Krorg](/characters/krorg) got a badass cape, [Spoops](/characters/spoops) got plate armor, [Drakham](/characters/drakham) spent a lot of money and agreed to an unscrupulous deal for a discount on armor, and [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert)... [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) keeps treating every cool little nick-nack he finds like crafting items in Minecraft to try and make a bunch of magic staffs, even though he already has one and just doesn't use it/doesn't make an attempt to use it.

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention the [Lucidel Illiard](/characters/lucidel-illiard) job with the Beholder in the king's vault. Don't worry; we'll be going over that in class on Wednesday, so until next time, you fucking **Low Bar Brawlers**.

## Session 18
###### April 18 2020

[Indecipherable]

I don't know, I'm drunk, and [Krorg](/characters/krorg) just swindled the [Pirate King](/characters/pirate-king) into making the [Pirate King](/characters/pirate-king) vulnerable on the demon soul front, as he can claim his BF and kick that for himself. 'Oh yay, [CBreezy](/characters/cbreezy) showed up and was disappointing but ultimately a good thing to get **LAWFUL GOOD** person.
