### **[Session Metadata]**
- **Date:** June 16th, 2025
- **Session Number:** 15
- **Duration:** 143.59 minutes
- **Players Present:** Missing Logan

### **[Recap of Previous Session]**
The party found themselves lost in the mysterious Owlwoods after leaving the Black Song cottage where they encountered necromancers. They discovered Friedrich's abandoned house (connected to Teegal's backstory) and stumbled upon several significant finds: a dragon egg which Tiberian initially hesitated to take before being convinced otherwise, a healing pool inhabited by young fairy dragons (claimed by Kael as his "nieces and nephews"), and Thomas Stonebrook pulling a blue-bladed mithril axe from a stone. Their attempts to navigate led them in circles until they found an abandoned campsite where they settled for rest. Key unresolved threads include the nature of Teegal's hag curse, the significance of the dragon egg, the purpose of the fairy dragons' pool, and the mysteries of the Owlwoods' ever-changing paths. The party also learned Kael knows some Draconic from past dragon encounters.

### **[Session Log] - Major Events (Entity-Relationship Focus)**

**Entities:**
- **PCs:**

3. **Breezy and Tiberian:** Tension over egg stewardship vs. Breezy's destructive tendencies
4. **Oran and Thomas:** Formed protective bond during shared fire dream
5. **Party and Asmartina:** First contact with mysterious fire entity through Oran's dream

**Important Dialogue:**
1. **Teegal:** "Must be real" (after kissing Kael in dream) - Reveals his reality-testing methods
2. **Breezy:** "I'm a bloodbird. What do you expect?" - Solidifying his violent persona
3. **Asmartina:** "You will never leave these woods" - Ominous threat to Oran
4. **Thomas:** "It's never over until we decide it's over" - Motivational moment for depressed Oran

**Notable Actions:**

2. **Fire Pissing:** Entire party collectively urinated on magical fire to banish Asmartina
3. **Spider Seduction Attempt:** Teegal's failed wild shape seduction of giant spider
4. **Owlbear Slaughter:** Party killed two owlbears (with legal consequences foreshadowed)

### **[Session Timeline]**

**1. Dream Divergence (1/3 session)**
The party split into two dream sequences while camping. Breezy, Kael and Teegal found themselves in a violet-watered realm with a mysterious altar containing shape-shifting bark instructions about blood sacrifice. Meanwhile, Oran and Thomas experienced a nightmare forest fire where Oran confronted his grief and first heard the name "Asmartina." Both dreams ended with violent ejections.

**2. Morning Aftermath (1/4 session)**
Upon waking, Breezy immediately tested the dream's blood sacrifice theory by dramatically cutting his arm on Teegal's sword (taking 13 damage). The party then collectively urinated on their campfire when Oran's whisper of "Asmartina" summoned a fiery face that threatened them.

**3. Cave Exploration (1/3 session)**
Following Breezy's navigation through the Owlwoods (path: right, right, left, right), they discovered a cave with owlbear and zombie remains. Splitting the party, some explored while others guarded outside. Teegal (as spider) and Breezy encountered a giant spider below, while others faced live owlbears above.

**4. Dual Combat (1/4 session)**
Simultaneous battles erupted - against the giant spider below (ended by Teegal's consumption) and two owlbears outside (killed despite being a "beyond deadly" encounter). Thomas tanked massive damage while raging, and the party discovered three owlbear eggs they decided to raise.

This session saw the party confront personal demons (literally and figuratively) while accumulating an improbable number of eggs to care for. The tone balanced dark themes (Oran's suicidal dream) with absurd humor (group urination), moving multiple character arcs forward while introducing new mysteries. Combat encounters pushed the party to their limits, revealing both strengths (Thomas' durability) and weaknesses (poor coordination). The owlbear eggs and bird law violation set up intriguing future complications.
