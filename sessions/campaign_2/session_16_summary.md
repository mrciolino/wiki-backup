### **[Session Metadata]**
- **Date:** June 23rd, 2025
- **Session Number:** 16
- **Duration:** 115.34 minutes
- **Players Present:** Logan, Nick, Breezy, Matthew, Josh (Missing Peter)

### **[Recap of Previous Session]**
The party found themselves trapped in the enchanted Alwood forest, navigating its confounding paths and encountering strange phenomena. Breezy, Kael, and Teagle experienced a shared dream of an underwater altar where Teagle (in spider form) kissed Kael and attempted to kiss Breezy, who reacted violently by tearing off his face. Meanwhile, Tiberian, Oren, and Thomas faced a forest fire vision where Tiberian heard the name "Martina" before walking into flames. Upon waking, Breezy cut his arm to fulfill the dream's demand that "the forest must turn red with blood," though this yielded no immediate effect. The group later discovered a cave containing two deadly owlbears and a spider, which Teagle successfully wild shaped into. After stealing owlbear eggs, the party attempted (with mixed success) to skin the creatures for pelts and construct a bone cart for transport.

**Unresolved Plot Threads:**
- Who is Martina and why did Tiberian hear her name?
- What is the significance of the "left, left, right" path system in Alwood?
- How will the party escape the enchanted forest's looping paths?
- What are the long-term consequences of Teagle's spider wild shape and hag magic?
- Will the party successfully raise the stolen owlbear and dragon eggs?
- How will Tiberian react when he learns the full truth about his brother's death?
- What is the nature of the archfey manipulating the woods?

### **[Session Timeline] - Chronological Events**

**1. Post-Dream Aftermath (1/4 session)**
The party awoke from their shared dreams, with Breezy immediately acting on his vision by cutting his arm. Tiberian's despair over his brother's death led him to walk into flames before hearing "Martina." The group extinguished a magical fire through unconventional means (collective urination), continuing a campaign tradition.

**2. Owlbear Cave Exploration (1/3 session)**
Navigating the cave system, the party fought and killed two owlbears. Teagle maintained his spider wild shape, causing initial party alarm. Breezy insisted on saving three owlbear eggs (6lbs total), while Tiberian mourned Terry's death in the earlier prison battle.

**3. Bone Cart Construction (1/4 session)**
After multiple failed attempts (including Teagle accidentally shooting himself as a spider), the party successfully built a bone cart from owlbear ribs. Tiberian consumed a mysterious red mushroom during this process, triggering his vision quest.

**4. Tiberian's Vision Quest (1/6 session)**
In a psychedelic fey realm, Tiberian met the Bear King who tasked him with destroying a corrupted hunting lodge and the prison they escaped. Received +1 warhammer and smithing tools as reward.

**5. Ruins Exploration (1/6 session)**
Breezy led party to strange ruins containing a glowing artifact which he stole and shattered, briefly illuminating a door before the party abandoned the site.

**6. Campfire Revelations (1/6 session)**
During long rest, Oren learned about his brother's death in prison. Tiberian and Kael delivered the news deceptively well, masking their involvement. Party prepared to ambush Grimsley's camp at dawn.
