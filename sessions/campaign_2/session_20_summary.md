### **[Session Metadata]**
- **Date:** July 28th, 2025
- **Session Number:** 20
- **Duration:** 189.02 minutes
- **Players Present:** All

### **[Recap of Previous Session]**
The party began by investigating graves in Eugene Rentica's graveyard, where Tiberian and Kael discovered a note in Eugene's coffin. Teegal encountered his life-force-linked magical tree (a result of hag curse). Oren wandered alone into the woods, discovering ruins with an ominous altar that rendered him unconscious after drawing blood. Meanwhile, the group invaded the prison, battling necronites (animated skeletal constructs) - including their former companion Runt who had been transformed into one. Tiberian summoned the Bear King's aid after being knocked unconscious. The session ended with Thomas unconscious, Tiberian stabilized but bleeding out, and Teegal in dire wolf form at 1 HP.

**Unresolved Plot Threads:**
- What secrets does Eugene Rentica's coffin note hold?
- Why was Oren drawn to the blood altar in the woods?
- What is the nature of Teegal's life-force connection to the magical tree?
- How did Runt become a necronite and what does this imply about other missing companions?
- What lies deeper within the prison's lower levels?
- Who controls the necronites and for what purpose?
- Will the Bear King's intervention provide safe passage through the Owl Woods?
- What caused the mechanical noises heard deeper in the prison?
