### **[Session Metadata]**
- **Date:** May 26th, 2025
- **Session Number:** 12
- **Duration:** 2.5 Hours
- **Players Present:** All

### **[Recap of Previous Session]**
The party found themselves trapped in the slave pits beneath the Church of Crows after being betrayed by Thomas Stonebrook. A desperate battle ensued as they fought their way through guards while simultaneously dealing with the awakening of Breezy Bee's blood sorcery powers. Oran's brother Verrick was tragically killed during the escape attempt, with Breezy performing a mercy killing that triggered his dark magical awakening. Meanwhile, new party members Cale (a plasmoid fighter) and Baloo (a bugbear bard) joined the fray, though Baloo would meet his end during this session's harrowing escape. The group managed to start a slave rebellion and reach a heavy door, but found themselves cornered by guards as the session ended on a cliffhanger.

**Unresolved Plot Threads:**
- What happened to Goopy Globulon after being separated from the party?
- Will the party recover Verrick's body for possible resurrection?
- What are the full implications of Breezy's awakened blood magic?
- Where exactly is the doomsday mechanism that was stolen from Tiberian?
- Who is the shadowy vampire figure connected to the Church of Crows?
- What secrets does prisoner Terry hold about the slave operation?
- How will the party navigate the Owlwoods without supplies?
- What is Archsorcerer Soulfire's true agenda?

### **[Session Timeline] - Chronological Events**

**1. Desperate Escape (1/3 session)**
The session opened with the party in mid-combat, desperately trying to escape the slave pits. Breezy awakened his blood magic during the fight, using chromatic orb and inflict wounds to devastating effect. Thomas was downed but miraculously survived three death saves. Tragically, Baloo was left behind and chose to end his own life rather than be captured. The party managed to escape into the Owlwoods with their prisoner Terry.

**2. Owlwoods Regrouping (1/4 session)**
Emerging into unfamiliar forest terrain, the exhausted and wounded party began interrogating Terry about possible secret entrances back into the slave compound. Tensions flared as Tiberian demanded his mechanism back from Oran, only to discover it had been stolen by Soulfire during their mind-link. The party debated next steps while coming to terms with their losses.

**3. Church Investigation (1/3 session)**
Flashback showed Oran and Osamir investigating the Church of Crows, finding it abandoned except for Vamir's drained body strung up like a grotesque decoration. They discovered evidence of vampire involvement but no sign of the missing party members. Osamir collected magical blood samples before sending Oran to Soulfire for help.

**4. Soulfire's "Help" (1/4 session)**
Soulfire provided three powerful scrolls (Raise Dead, Fireball, Greater Restoration) and a portal to the Owlwoods - but not before secretly stealing the doomsday mechanism during their mental connection. Oran arrived just in time to be punched by Tiberian, creating immediate tension within the regrouped party.
