### **[Session Metadata]**
- **Date:** July 17th, 2025
- **Session Number:** 18
- **Duration:** 158.06 minutes
- **Players Present:** All except Teegal

### **[Recap of Previous Session]**
The party found themselves split during a nighttime ambush on Grimsley and his guards near a waterfall. Tiberian, Kael, Thomas, and Oran positioned themselves on a ridge while Breezy and Teegal (in snake form) crossed the frigid river below. Combat ensued with the party eliminating most guards, though one escaped and another named Jeffrey was captured. Prior to this, Thomas encountered a mysterious old man identifying himself as Vermez-Yobbs (an acronym for "Vamir boss"), resulting in tense standoff where Thomas deduced the man couldn't cross water. The party executed Grimsley after his confession of crimes, debating the legality but ultimately agreeing to the execution. As the session concluded, the group was divided - Oran fled with prisoner Jeffrey while the others returned to their makeshift bone-and-fur cart.

**Unresolved Plot Threads:**
- What are Vermez-Yobbs' true capabilities and limitations?
- Will the escaped guard bring reinforcements from the prison outpost?
- How will Oran and Jeffrey navigate the enchanted woods alone?
- What assistance can the Bear King provide against the prison forces?
- How does Asmartina's curse on Teegal connect to the larger conflict?
- What is the true nature of the Black Song necromancers' activities?
- Are there other factions operating within the Alwood Forest?
