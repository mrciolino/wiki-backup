### **[Session Metadata]**
- **Date:** June 2nd, 2025
- **Session Number:** 3
- **Duration:** 2 Hours
- **Players Present:** All

### **[Recap of Previous Session]**
Last session saw the party escaping from a prison facility after a brutal confrontation that resulted in the deaths of Blue and Ballou. Blue chose to sacrifice himself dramatically with an invisible shotgun to cover the party's escape. The group took a prisoner named Terry and fled into the Owl Woods, where Oren was unexpectedly teleported back to the party by Arch Sorcerer Tandemar Soulfire - only to have the crucial "mechanism" device stolen from him immediately. Flashbacks revealed Oren and Osdemir's investigation of the Church of Crows, discovering Vamir's vampire-drained corpse and magical blood samples. Tensions ran high as Tiberian blamed Oren for the mechanism's loss and subsequent deaths. The session ended with the party fleeing into the dense Owl Woods with guards in pursuit, exhausted and wounded.

**Unresolved Plot Threads:**
- Can the party escape the pursuing guards through the maze-like Owl Woods?
- What are the true intentions of Headmaster Soulfire in stealing the mechanism?
- How will the party recover their dead companions without access to resurrection magic?
- What is the nature of the vampire threat at the Church of Crows?
- Will Tiberian's hostility toward Oren escalate further?
- Who is Renault and what is his connection to the prison operations?
- What consequences will come from taking Terry prisoner?

### **[Session Timeline] - Chronological Events**

**1. Fleeing Through the Owl Woods (1/3 session)**
The party, still pursued by guards, fled deeper into the dense Owl Woods. After heated debate about forest navigation, they devised a system of keeping the sun to their left through successive forks in the path. The woods' magical nature became apparent as similar-looking forks repeated unnaturally. Tiberian took leadership in the escape, while newcomer Kael struggled with the party's dynamics and his own PTSD flashbacks triggered by Tiberian's words.

**2. Discovery of the Empty Graveyard (1/3 session)**
The exhausted party stumbled upon a robbed graveyard with disturbed earth and broken headstones (including one marked "Eugene Vrentica"). They took shelter in a mausoleum, with Breezy nesting in a nearby tree. During watch rotations, both Breezy and Oran heard enchanting singing that turned out to be Arissa Black Song arriving with spectral servants. After initial tension, she invited them to her nearby cottage for proper rest.

**3. Revelations at Black Song Cottage (1/3 session)**
At the cottage, the party met Arissa's husband Oloon and their friend Teegal Beetal - a druid cursed by a hag. Over breakfast, they interrogated Terry, convincing him to join their cause. Teegal shared his curse (tied to a magical tree's fruit) and joined the party. The Black Songs revealed their necromancy by gifting Teegal control of three "scarecrow" zombies, leading to moral debates and an impromptu zombie Thriller performance before the session ended.
