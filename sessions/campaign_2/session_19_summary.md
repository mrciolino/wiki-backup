### [Session Metadata]
- **Date:** July 21st, 2025
- **Session Number:** 19
- **Duration:** 148.48 minutes
- **Players Present:** Missing Josh (Teegal)

### [Recap of Previous Session]
The party received ominous visions from the Bear King while navigating the treacherous Owl Woods. Tensions flared when Oran attempted to sacrifice their prisoner Jeffrey in a corpse-filled well, prompting Thomas to intervene violently. This led to an ideological clash between Thomas and Kael, culminating in a non-lethal duel that Kael won, forcing Thomas to reconsider his aggressive approach. The group later made contact with the mysterious Bear King, who offered guidance toward escaping the woods by assaulting a prison complex. However, their first reconnaissance mission ended disastrously when they triggered explosive necrotic traps among crucified prisoners. Meanwhile, Tiberian uncovered disturbing evidence linking their former allies, the Black Songs, to necromantic practices involving the well's corpses. The session ended with the party battered but determined to press forward with the Bear King's plan.

**Unresolved Plot Threads:**
- What is the true nature of the Bear King's connection to the Owl Woods?
- Who are the mysterious "Necronites" guarding the prison?
- What happened to Oran after he separated from the party in the woods?
- Why were Jeffrey and others brought to the prison initially?
- What is the significance of the blood altar Oran discovered?
- How are the Black Songs connected to the prison operations?
- Will the party recover Runt's stolen greatsword?
