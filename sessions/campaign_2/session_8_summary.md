### **[Session Metadata]**
- **Date:** April 28th, 2025 
- **Session Number:** 8
- **Duration:** ~3 hours
- **Players Present:** Logan (Tiberian), Nick (Goopy), Breezy (Breezy Bee), Matthew (Oran), Peter (Thomas), Ryan (DM)

### **[Recap of Previous Session]**
The party received an urgent message from Vamir of the Church of Crows, reducing Oran's deadline to retrieve the "mechanism" from one month to two days under threat of his brother being sold into slavery. Tiberian was revealed to possess a dangerous orb (the mechanism) - a powerful energy source created by his mother that Clan Euryxias covets. The group split to gather resources: Goopy and Breezy sought magical items/backup, while Thomas and Oran investigated leads at the academy. Key developments included:
- Tiberian handing the depression-inducing orb to Oran during a mental breakdown
- Thomas learning his father is magically enslaved by Archsorcerer Soulfire
- Oran securing the orb in a magic-suppressing box from Osdemir
- Recruitment of Runt, the academy's battle-hardened gardener

**Unresolved Plot Threads:**
1. Can the party rescue Oran's brother without surrendering the orb?
2. What is the true nature/power of Tiberian's orb?
3. How is Vamir connected to Clan Euryxias?
4. Will Thomas pursue vengeance against the Admiral who killed his mother?
5. Can the party maintain cover while transporting illegal weapons into Vrentia?
6. What are Soulfire's true motives regarding Thomas' father?
7. How will the party navigate the Church of Crows' slave operations?
