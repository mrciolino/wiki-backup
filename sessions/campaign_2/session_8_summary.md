### **[Session Metadata]**  
**Date:** April 29, 2025  
**Session Number:** 8  

---

### **[Recap of Previous Session]**  
- The party learned the black orb (the "mechanism") is a dangerous power source created by Tiberian's mother, capable of catastrophic destruction if misused.  
- Oran's brother Verrick is held hostage by Vamir, who demanded the orb within 2 days or Verrick would be sold into slavery.  
- The party split to prepare: securing a fake orb (Tiberian's creation), recruiting allies (Runt), and investigating the Church of Crows.  

**Unresolved Threads:**  
- Rescue Verrick without handing over the real orb.  
- Survive the fight against Vamir's forces, including the shadow-teleporting half-orc assassin.  
- Prevent the orb from falling into enemy hands (Clan Norexias/Vamir).  
- Thomas's vendetta against Admiral Walter Bestwater Vrintia (mother's murderer).
