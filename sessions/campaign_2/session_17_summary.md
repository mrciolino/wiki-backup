### **[Session Metadata]**
- **Date:** July 7th, 2025
- **Session Number:** 17
- **Duration:** 156.08 minutes
- **Players Present:** All

### **[Recap of Previous Session]**
The party had recently attempted to construct a bone cart from owlbear remains with questionable success. Tiberian consumed mysterious mushrooms, leading to a psychedelic encounter with the Bear King who tasked them with eliminating threats at a hunting lodge and mines, rewarding Tiberian with a warhammer and artisan tools. Meanwhile, Oran discovered Grimsley's group at a waterfall, prompting the party to plan an ambush. Emotional tensions ran high as Tiberian and Kael informed Oran about his brother's death (omitting their involvement), portraying Verick as a hero. The session concluded with the party positioning for their waterfall assault, with Breezy and Teagle preparing to flank while Tiberian, Thomas, and Kael approached from the north. Unresolved threads included the Bear King's quests, Oran's search for his father, Teagle's curse, Thomas's desire to reclaim his dagger from Grimsley, and the mysterious disappearances of their zombie allies.

**Unresolved Plot Threads:**
1. Will the party fulfill the Bear King's requests at the hunting lodge and mines?
2. How will Oran react when he learns the full truth about his brother's death?
3. Can Teagle's curse be lifted through their current endeavors?
4. What consequences will follow from the escaped guard and Vermeys Yobs' appearance?
5. How will the party navigate the moral complexities of Grimsley's redemption arc?
