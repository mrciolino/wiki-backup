### **[Session Metadata]**
- **Date:** June 9th, 2025
- **Session Number:** 14
- **Duration:** 154.965 minutes
- **Players Present:** All

### **[Recap of Previous Session]**
The party escaped pursuing guards through the warping forest paths of the Owlwoods, finding temporary shelter with the Black Songs necromancers. During their stay, they were gifted three zombie scarecrows under Breezy Bee's control, named after fallen comrades - a concerning but potentially useful development. Tiberian made progress in aligning Terry, their prisoner, with their cause. The session ended with the party preparing to depart the Black Song cottage, having witnessed their undead minions perform a macabre rendition of the Thriller dance. Key unresolved threads include the hag's curse on Teegal Beetal, the missing mechanism now in Soul Fire's possession, and the party's tenuous alliance with the necromancers. The forest's magical disorientation continues to hinder their progress, and tensions remain high regarding their next course of action.

**Unresolved Plot Threads:**
- How will the party break Teegal Beetal's hag curse?
- Where is the missing mechanism now held by Soul Fire?
- What are the long-term consequences of allying with the Black Songs necromancers?
- Will the zombie scarecrows remain under control?
- How will the party navigate the magically distorted Owlwoods?
