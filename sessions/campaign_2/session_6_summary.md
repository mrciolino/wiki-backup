### **Session Metadata**  
- **Date**: April 15, 2025  
- **Session Number**: 6  



### **Recap of Previous Session**  
The party bonded over breakfast, sharing backstories and pledging mutual support for their goals (Tiberian’s vendetta, Oran’s rescue mission, Goopy’s time-traveling quest, etc.). They attended the Sorting Ceremony at the Cathedral of Os, where they were assigned to Schools (Sorcery, Swords, Song) and Signs (Dragon, Spider, Bear). Tiberian attempted to warn professors about a suspicious Brass Dragonborn from Clan Norexias but was dismissed. The session ended with festivities and the party preparing for their first academic year.


### **Session Log**  
#### **Major Events**  
1. **Post-Ceremony Festivities**:  
   - The party split:  
     - **Goopy & Tiberian** went to the stables’ cellar to kill rats, loot jerky/wine, and get drunk. Goopy fashioned a rat-cloak.  
     - **Breezy B** attempted to bring book goblins to the cathedral, but one combusted due to holy wards. He confronted Professor Rose about the injustice.  
     - **Thomas** visited his father, who guards a useless tower door, and learned of his ambition for Thomas to become head guard of the Golden Citadel.  
     - **Baloo** interviewed Professor Rose and joined a heavy metal choir led by Professor Bomber Blackhammer.  

2. **Book Goblin Incident**:  
   - Breezy’s book goblin died in the cathedral, revealing the kingdom’s discriminatory laws against non-believers. The party debated the morality of the system.  

3. **First Day of Classes**:  
   - **Goopy** barged into the wrong classroom (covered in rats) and was directed to Professor Daryl Isosaria.  
   - **Tiberian** woke up hungover in a donkey cart.  
   - **Baloo** shredded on a skull-adorned magic guitar in religious music class.  
   - **Thomas** made progress in remedial reading.  
   - **Breezy** seethed over the kingdom’s oppressive laws during his law class.  

#### **Key Relationships & Developments**  
- **Party Cohesion**: Strengthened through shared goals (e.g., supporting Tiberian against Clan Norexias, Oran’s brother’s rescue).  
- **Discrimination Theme**: The book goblin’s death highlighted systemic bigotry, motivating Breezy and Baloo to advocate for change.
