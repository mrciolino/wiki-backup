### **[Session Metadata]**
- **Date:** May 19th, 2025
- **Session Number:** 11
- **Duration:** 3 Hours
- **Players Present:** All

### **[Recap of Previous Session]**
Last session saw our party trapped in the Church of Crows' lower slave pits after being captured by Grimsley and his forces. The group was taunted with Runt's severed head, sparking particular rage in Tiberian despite his limited connection to the fallen comrade. Ballou miraculously awoke from his coma, was handed an invisible blunderbuss by their mysterious benefactor, and teleported into their cell to stage a breakout. After freeing themselves, the party encountered mindless slave workers and engaged guards in combat. Thomas and Breezy became separated - with Breezy searching upstairs for bird law texts while Thomas eventually rejoined the fight. The session ended with the party regrouping at the base of a staircase, wounded but determined to escape, while Ballou and Tiberian bore the brunt of the fighting.

**Unresolved Plot Threads:**
- What is Renault creating with Goopy's remains in the hidden chamber?
- Will Thomas survive his interrogation with Grimsley and Renault?
- How will the party escape the Church of Crows with multiple enemies converging?
- What are the long-term consequences of Breezy embracing blood magic?
- Will Verick's death be discovered by Orrin?
- What is the true nature of the prophecy guiding Kael Stelorian?
- Who is pulling the strings behind the Church of Crows' operations?

### **[Session Timeline]**

**1. Prison Break Continuation (1/3 session)**
The session opened with the party regrouping after their initial breakout. Ballou and Tiberian looted fallen guards while Kael Stelorian mysteriously appeared in the slave pits. After a tense introduction where Ballou accidentally shot Kael, the group debated escape routes - either through the mining pits or upstairs. They eventually chose the upstairs route, sending Breezy ahead to scout.

**2. Verick's Demise (1/3 session)**
Verick suffered a catastrophic spinal injury attempting to hold open a security door. Despite attempts by Kael (who made things worse with amateur "surgery") and Breezy to help, Verick's condition proved fatal. In a heartbreaking scene, Breezy performed a mercy killing, which triggered his awakening as a blood sorcerer when a mysterious voice guided him to use Verick's life force.

**3. Renault's Creation (1/3 session)**
Kael discovered the hidden laboratory where Renault was using Goopy's remains to create some sort of mechanized undead construct. After failing to communicate with the chained creature, Kael attacked it, inadvertently helping it break free. Meanwhile, Thomas was captured and interrogated by Grimsley and Renault. The session ended with the party attempting a desperate escape as multiple threats converged.
