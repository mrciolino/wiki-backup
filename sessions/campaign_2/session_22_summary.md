### **[Session Metadata]**
- **Date:** August 4th, 2025
- **Session Number:** 22
- **Duration:** 181.65 minutes
- **Players Present:** Logan, Nick, Breezy, Matthew, Josh, Ryan (DM) (Peter absent)

### **[Recap of Previous Session]**
The party descended into the slave pits beneath the Church of Crows, discovering crucified slaves rigged with necrotic bombs. After cleverly using ropes to navigate safely, they encountered a monstrous Hellweaver Spider - a CR12 creature far beyond their level - which instantly downed Thomas and slaughtered the four owl bears lent by the Bear King. The group barely escaped with their lives, though Thomas and Breezy remained trapped in the pit with the spider while others fled to the surface. Unresolved threads include the spider's origin, the purpose of the mining operation, the fate of the missing jailers, and how to fulfill their bargain with the Bear King.

**Unresolved Plot Threads:**
- What created the chain-shooting Hellweaver Spider?
- Why were the necromancers mining fairy fossil crystals?
- Where did the living jailers disappear to?
- How can we complete our mission for the Bear King?
- What was Renault's true agenda with the mechanism?
