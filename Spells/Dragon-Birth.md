components V, S, M (Rare inks from a deep ocean Starsquid, paints made from the blood of an almiraj, incense from crushed fairie or pixie wings, Diamond, Emerald, Sapphire, ruby, amethyst, and topaz dust worth 10,000gp, 100lbs of gold per person, 1 fresh dragon egg per person) which the spell consumes
  
You and at minimum two ritual assistants or maximum eight other ritual assitants use the rare materials to draw up a 60ft by 60ft square ritual area with arcane runes and glyphs within a dragon sanctuary, you and the attendants will after creating the ritual site will bring the gold and gem dust to the center where the lead caster is conducting the spell then start to channel the magic energies through the gold and gem dust towards the fresh dragon eggs which will be placed closely around the lead caster. Then for the next week plus the lead caster will continue to concentrate on the spell chanting the magic phrase over and over while the assistants burn incense and make rounds around the area chanting and surrendering their magic to the main caster as well and maintaing the the magic and sanctity of the magic ritual. after the long casting time all will be drawn to an egg they will hold it close and their soul will transfer to the egg and soon after all will hatch from their eggs and be dragon hatchlings and then over the next days all involved will rapidly grow corresponding to the power of the caster/attendant to a proper dragon equivalent minimum of adult, maximum of ancient Dragon. Once at the end of this growth stage the casters will be true dragons and gain all the benefits, and in case of player characters will retain their class levels and will add 3/4 of the max HP of the dragon they turned to the their own max HP  (rounded up to nearest whole number) . Other dragons and anyone else using magic to discern you will consider you to be a dragon and only by using magic to see the origianal ritual itself would they be able to conclude your weren't always a dragon. When turned into a dragon the length of your life is extended to 10,000 years and may benefit from any abilties or features which affect its length for the positive, it cannot be shortened unless you were to die from diesease or trauma, or extremely potent magic used against you to undo this ritual (nearly impossible) or curse you so severly that the equivalent would be an entire kingdom being cursed at the same time. Draconic attitudes and innate desires do not directly transfer to you nor warp your personality from what it was before aka lust of treasure, air of superiority, monstrous behavior, etc.. unless you choose to behave like that or already were like that.
