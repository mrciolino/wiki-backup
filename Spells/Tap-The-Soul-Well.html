<p><strong>Description</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Access the soul well for various effects.</p>
<p>The caster chooses to one of the following effects which will remain as the active effect for the duration of the spell or until changed by the caster. While the spell is active, as a bonus action, the caster can choose to change the active effect to any of the other effects.</p>
<p>Casting time: 1 action</p>
<p>Duration: 1 hour</p>
<p>Attack:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Power from the Well flows into your attacks, the combined power of countless souls is drawn from the Well, empowering your attacks. Each melee or spell attack you make causes a wave of Spiritual energy to pulse out from your attacks, striking your targets.</li>
  <li>Add +5 to melee and spell Attack rolls</li>
  <li>On a hit, the deluge of souls washing over your target causes mental anguish. They must roll on the Short-term-madness table.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Defense:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You allow the energies of the Well to harmlessly engulf you, wrapping you in an ever flowing cloak of Souls.</li>
  <li>The flowing cloak obscures your form, attacks against you have disadvantage.</li>
  <li>The flow of souls protect you from incoming damage. The cloak has a pool &nbsp;of HP equal to the caster’s HP, while the spell is active, this pool regenerates to full at the end of every round.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Travel:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Range: touch</li>
  <li>The caster can enter the well or throw someone else into the well. The well can be entered by creatures possessing physical bodies or by disembodied souls.</li>
  <li>A creature being thrown into the well against their will must first be successfully grappled. A willing creature or disembodied soul only needs to be pushed by the caster.</li>
  <li>Diving into the Well transports you to the chosen location. However, if you enter the Well while still possessing a body, you will “wash ashore”, emerging from a “body of water” closest to your intended destination.</li>
  <li>Disembodied souls entering the Well can also choose a body that is deceased or otherwise lacking a soul as their destination.</li>
  <li>You magically emerge from the water Prone.</li>
  <li>The body of water can be any water for example: an ocean, puddle, cup of water. The liquid itself must be or contain water, for example: seawater, juice, alcoholic beverages, etc. are all water based liquids. However, oil, liquified solids such as lava, molten glass, etc. would not be valid liquids.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knowledge:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As an action you can reach into the well in search of the Soul of a creature with knowledge you seek.</li>
  <li>As you reach into the Well, Roll 1d20 to determine how much your chosen Soul knows about your chosen topic.</li>
  <li>The Soul is compelled to answer truthfully to the best of their knowledge.</li>
  <li>You may continue to hold onto and interrogate a soul up to the duration of the Spell, releasing the soul from your grasp sends it back into the Well.</li>
</ul>
