          <p>All magical effects or magic items touched by the spellcaster, except for those that you carry or have equipped, are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like effects are separated into their individual components (ending the effect as a dispel magic spell does), and each permanent magic item must make a successful Wisdom save or be turned into a normal item. An item in a creature’s possession uses its own Wisdom save bonus or its possessor’s Wisdom save bonus, whichever is higher.</p>
          <p>You also have a 20% chance of destroying an antimagic field. If the antimagic field survives the disjunction, no items within it are disjoined.</p>
          <p>Even artifacts are subject to disjunction, though there is only a 20% chance of actually affecting such powerful items. Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, you must make a DC 30 Wisdom save or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities. (These abilities cannot be recovered by mortal magic, not even wish, only by direct divine intervention.)</p>
          <p><strong>Note</strong>: Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and it is 95% likely to attract the attention of some powerful being who has an interest in or connection with the device.</p>
