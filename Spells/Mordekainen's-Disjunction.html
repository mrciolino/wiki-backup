<h1>Mordekainen's Disjunction</h1>
<p>After the party contracted the <a href="/organizations/Adventurer's-Guild">Adventurer's Guild</a>&nbsp;to gather individuals named <a href="/characters/Gond">Gond </a>into an event space in <a href="/locations/Mardun/Fywick">Fywick</a>, Bazzdos, Spoops, Adalynn, and Breezy-E devised a clever plan to liberate the trapped Gond souls. The Guild, skilled in their craft, strategically placed various scrolls around the event hall. These scrolls, primarily Scrolls of Hold Person, were rigged together like a time bomb set to trigger at midnight. Throughout the celebration, a stage performer continuously hinted at a surprise guest arriving at midnight, ensuring that all 478 gnomes named Gond were present in the main hall at the appointed time. When the scrolls activated, the party swiftly ushered the gnomes through a portal leading to a cave, where they had approximately an hour before the spell's effects wore off.</p>
<p>Ages ago, the Dead Three played a cruel joke on Gond, the god of craft, smithing, and inventiveness. They fractured his soul into thousands of fragments and scattered them across the realm. Over time, a significant number of these fragments were discovered near Krorg's hometown on Mardun, embedded in gnomes who all shared the name Gond. Each of these gnomes carried a portion of Gond's essence.</p>
<p>In the cave, Spoops set up an operating table, a thousand empty soul crystals, and a recovery area. One by one, Spoops—assisted by Bazzdos—performed delicate soul surgery on each Gond, extracting a small portion of their soul that contained a fragment of the god. These fragments were stored in the crystals for later use. The gnomes were left weakened and disoriented after the extraction, so the party established a rehabilitation zone to help them recover before sending them back to Krorg's hometown. While not all Gonds were originally from there, no prescreening was conducted to verify their origins. Curiously, post-surgery, every Gond claimed to hail from Krorg’s hometown.</p>
<p>Once all the soul crystals were collected, Bazzdos extended his Soul Core to accommodate the additional Gond fragments, intending to resurrect the god by offering himself as a vessel. When all 478 soul fragments were placed within him, Bazzdos gained a divine boon and unlocked the following spell:</p>

          <h4><strong>Mordenkainen’s Disjunction</strong></h4>
          <p><strong>Level:</strong> 9</p>
          <p>All magical effects or magic items touched by the spellcaster—except those carried or equipped—are disjoined. Spells and spell-like effects are separated into their individual components, ending their effects as <i>dispel magic</i> would. Each permanent magic item must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or revert to a non-magical state. Items in a creature’s possession use either their own Wisdom save bonus or their possessor’s, whichever is higher.</p>
          <p>Additionally, there is a 20% chance of destroying an <i>antimagic field</i>. If the field survives, no items within it are affected.</p>
          <p>Even artifacts are subject to disjunction, though only a 20% chance exists of affecting such powerful items. If an artifact is destroyed, the caster must make a DC 30 Wisdom saving throw or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities. These abilities cannot be restored by mortal magic, including <i>wish</i>, but only through direct divine intervention.</p>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> Destroying artifacts is perilous and has a 95% likelihood of drawing the attention of a powerful being with a vested interest in the artifact.</p>
