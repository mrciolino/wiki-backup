# Moving Mountains

A custom spell for [Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) that enables the levitation and movement of entire mountain ranges.

## Spell Description

**Transmutation Spell (Level 10, Ritual)**

| **Casting Time** | **Range** | **Target** | **Components** | **Duration** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Day | Touch (Ritual Area) | A designated mountain | V, S, M (special inks, salts, honey, trapped air elementals) | Instantaneous; Concentration up to 1 week |

**Description**: The caster uses a ritual involving crystals and air elementals to levitate a mountain. For one week, the caster must concentrate to keep it afloat. Once the maelstrom stabilizes, the mountain can fly autonomously at 40 miles/day unless powered further by spell slots. Alterations must not compromise its structure or balance.
