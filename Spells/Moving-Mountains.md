level 10 Transmutation
  
ritual
  
casting time 1 Day
  
Duration instantaneous; concentration 1 week
  
components V, S, M (Rare inks made frrom the blood of umberhulks, salts refined from dried lake beds once blessed by an ocean deity, honey produced by bees which have gathered their pollen from plants which live high up on mountain peaks, a trapped air elemental per 10ft of height of mountain you are moving) which the spell consumes
  
You wil mix the rare materials to form crystals then place the crystals as you were drawing up a square ritual area around the base of the mountain, you will after creating the ritual site will bring the trapped air elemental to the center where the caster is conducting the spell then start to channel the magic energies through the ritual crystals towards the aire elementals which will be placed closely around the caster. Then for the next day the caster will continue to concentrate on the spell controlling the magic and the air elementals with in the ritual area. after the casting time the part of the mountain designated in the ritual area will then be cut from the rock and start to float up into the sky as the air elementals essences are consumed in a powerful maelstrom and releasing their entrappments. The caster then needs to concentrate on maintaing the mountain's flight in the maelstrom, if concentration is ended early even for a moment the mountain will fall from the sky. After a week of this the maelstrom will settle and the mountain will sustain its own flight at the caster's command and can move on its own as long it is in air. The mountain's movement is slow it can only move 40 miles a day unless additional spell slots are sacrificed to the mountain; to move throughout other mediums besides air more additional spell slots must be sacrificed by the original caster. The mountain itself may be changed or altered as long as the edges by the crystals are not broken off or destroyed, also that the mountain being moved isn't rendered structurally unsound by any means i.e.(excessive excavation, the earthquake spell, a explosion occuring deep within the moving rock, etc...). Structures may be built on or out of the mountain their weight doesn't have an effect on the flight of th mountain. strcutures going past the ritual circle will have an effect on the mountains aerodynamics, will slow and make the mountain lean towards the overreaching strucutrer given it isn't balanced out on the other side or the original caster doesn't concentrate on righting the flying rock.
