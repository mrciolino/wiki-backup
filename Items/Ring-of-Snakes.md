# Ring of Snakes

## Abilities

The wearer may activate the ring with a wave of their hand, summoning 1 - 3 snakes in front of them. These snakes are randomly selected from any snakes existing in the current plane. 
While the ring will generally summon normal snakes,the ring's definition of snakes is flexible. It has been known to be able to summon dragons or serpents, as well as liars or traitors, all fitting the loose definition of snake.
