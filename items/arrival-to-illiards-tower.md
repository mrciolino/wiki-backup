# Arrival to Illiard's Tower
[Krorg](/characters/krorg) and his pirates lead the infiltration of [Illiard's](/characters/illiard) tower with the goal of killing [Freedom](/characters/freedom).


## Krorg's Crew
This pirate crew came together after the pirate boarding at sea gone wrong on the way to [Allford](/locations/Mardun/Allford). As Krorg ended up marooned on the shore of [Saragassa](/locations/Mardun/Saragassa) with the pirate [Nathar](/characters/nathar). He was still looking to kill Freedom. They met with the [Pirate King](/characters/pirate-king) and added [Dave Bones](/characters/dave-bones), [Darfallen](/characters/darfallen), and [Xialethia](/characters/xialethia) to the Freedom kill team. They followed Freedom accross the sea to Allford and found clues pointing to Illiard's Tower. They burst into the city sewers to enter the tower at its weakest point to avoid the defenses Freedom would have put up. Little did they know, the defenses they were avoiding didn't exist and they were heading for a trap. Luckily they ran into the rest of the party who happened to be in the same sewer system. After reuniting Krorg had his new crew dispel the firewall stopping the party from proceeding. 


## Entering The Tower
Then the group moved forward and searched the next room only to find gibbets filled with corpses.

[Spoops](/characters/spoops) checks out the nearby bedroom while [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) goes back to search some unexplored rooms and finds more cob webs and spider egg clutches, but leaves as he hears ominous scuttling noises. Soon after, the pickpocket that was confonted in the sewers was torn to shreds by some unknown creature. The party left him to his fate.


## Encountering a Necrotic Wizard
After some searching, Spoops and Bazzert find a book and unlock the ability to unlock and lock a certain door. Krorg blocks the path behind the party while Spoops opens up a door to see a woman surrounded by four skeletal ogres. The woman unleashes the ogres and a storm of fireballs at the party. However, with some luck and perseverance, the party weathers the storm and defeats the evil necrotic wizard.


## Confronting Illiard
The party then navigates some very dangerous fireball traps and another pool of shit, only to find themselves at the bottom of deep 35 ft. pit with random trash being dropped down on them.

After confronting the one dropping the trash, they find out they are Lucidel Illiard (Remember him kids he'll be important) owner of Illiard Tower and and a Merchant Lord of Allford. 

After helping the party out of the hole, he introduces himself and tells them that Freedom is in the other room. 


## Freedom's (Lokunai) Soul is Sealed
Freedom arrives after being called, seeming to be beat up and a bit waterlogged. Upon arriving, he is confronted by Dave Bones, Krorg and the other pirates. Dave pulls out an ancient magic jar, The [Hendrica Capsule](/items/hendrica-capsule), and sucks the soul out of Freedom. Everyone looks on as red ominous demonic tendrils lash from the robotic frame to the insides of the jar and are sealed by Dave Bones. Freedom's body goes limp and falls to the floor.

With their business done the pirates start to leave, but Nathar confronts the others saying he is there to kill Freedom for destroying his ships at sea. Dave Bones replies with "If ya here for death then I'll give it to ya!" and Shanks Nathar in the neck and Nathar falls, instantly bleeding to death.


## An Insane Intro To Illiard and Beginning of the Quest
After such an unexpected and grizzly scene, Bazzert asks Illiard if he can read him a book, and Spoops asks for help trying to get a giant spider to hatch from a spider egg so it can be his pet.

The utter psychotic levels of emotional awareness being shown forced Illiard to notice the glow from Spoops pants (No this is not getting sexual). Illiard asks Spoops if he has any magic items in his pocket. Spoops reveals the demonic stone that he received from his demon boytoy [Lokunai](/characters/lokunai) from the Fort Suro bar. Illiard then reveals the stones true nature, a soul prison, and he releases the soul within it which flows back into Freedoms body. This causes freedom's empty body to rise back to life. 

Illiard explains that when Spoops killed the demon as it lay covered in booze, bleeding and dying, he actually had helped finish a demon ritual that trapped Freedom's soul in the stone that Spoops had been holding and it put the Demon's soul into Freedom's body. 

Now with Freedom restored, the truth revealed, and the party having met Illiard, he asks them if they've been to [Fort Suro](/locations/Mardun/Fort-Suro). They respond yes, and Illiard says that he has a job for them.
