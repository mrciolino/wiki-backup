<h1>Gauntlets of Devastation</h1>
<p>Necrotic Gauntlets forged in the Soul Forge under <strong>Witch King Base.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>When the Witch Kings base fell to the Phoenix King, <a href="/characters/bane">Bane</a> (then known to the party as the Witch King) trusted us with his revenge. Bane removed his ring and entrusted the party to trick the Phoenix King into putting the ring on, effectively taking over his body. The rest of Bane's armor was confiscated the party, mainly <a href="/characters/bazzdos">Bazzdos</a>.</p>
