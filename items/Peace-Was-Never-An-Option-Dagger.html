<p>A holy relic, the Iron Halo was once blessed by the Goddess Of fire Pyrocinae, granting it the power to emit her holy fire, allowing the wearer to deal fire damage to any who dare approach.</p>
<h1>Origin</h1>
<p>The blade was obtained by Spoops during the party’s first visit to Fywick. While meeting with the Oracle of Fywick, the party was attacked by a Demonic Goose wielding the dagger. The Goose would speak the activation phrase and the dagger would fly at its target. After defeating the Goose, Spoops took the dagger and spoke the phrase. Spoops managed to hold onto the dagger as it shot through the window next to him and he was dragged through the air to the island in the middle of the city.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After losing his leg below the knee during the battle of Fywick, Spoops attached the dagger to his tibia using Sovereign Glue. this new prosthetic allowed him use of the dagger’s abilities without requiring a strength check to maintain his grip on the blade.</p>
