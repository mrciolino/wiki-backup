          <p>as a reaction after hitting a creature with the blade you may teleport behind a creature and make an attack on them with said blade, if you say "heh nothing personal kid" you get a plus 2d6 damage to the attack, if the target also fails the CHA check they are angered to such a degree that they only will fight you, also the wielder is resistant to psychic damage, and the target's resistance to necrotic damage is negated</p>
