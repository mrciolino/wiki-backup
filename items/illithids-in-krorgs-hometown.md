# Illithids in Krorg's Hometown
The Party travel to Krorg's Hometown to prepare for an imminent Illithid Invasion.

## The Oracle's Vision
The Oracle rushes to the Mortis Lix throne room to warn the party of a vision she received. She saw a vision of a small force of Illithids arriving in Krorg's Hometown. The party jump into action, mobilizing a small fleet of ships to gate to the town.

## Arrival in Krorg's Hometown
The party arrive in the town to find it already in chaos. The Gonds that the party previously sent here have arrived, and the townsfolk have no idea what to do with them. The party seek out the mayor to resolve the Gond situation, and begin preparations for the Illithids. 

The mayor is an absolute idiot who doesn't want to do any work. The party tell him they will subsidize the living arrangements for all the Gonds and they need to begin preparing for battle. The mayor clearly has no idea how to lead his people so eventually the party just address his people directly.

The party soon find out that the people here have basically no defenses, so Mortis Lux has to do everything.
