# Illithids in Krorg's Hometown
The Party travel to Krorg's Hometown to prepare for an imminent Illithid Invasion.

*Note*: Current population of Krorg's Hometown is 5776

## The Oracle's Vision
The Oracle rushes to the Mortis Lix throne room to warn the party of a vision she received. She saw a vision of a small force of Illithids arriving in Krorg's Hometown. The party jump into action, mobilizing a small fleet of ships to gate to the town.

## Arrival in Krorg's Hometown
The party arrive in the town to find it already in chaos. The Gonds that the party previously sent here have arrived, and the townsfolk have no idea what to do with them. The party seek out the mayor to resolve the Gond situation, and begin preparations for the Illithids. 

The mayor is an absolute idiot who doesn't want to do any work. The party tell him they will subsidize the living arrangements for all the Gonds and they need to begin preparing for battle. The mayor clearly has no idea how to lead his people so eventually the party just address his people directly.

The party soon find out that the people here have basically no defenses, so Mortis Lux has to do everything. 


## The Illithids Arrive
As the party is explaining the situation to the townsfolk in the center of town, the Illithids begin their attack. Some of the townsfolk had already been infected by tadpoles, so they turn into mind flayers in the middle of the crowd and begin their attack. One of their ships is also atttacked while above the town. The Nautiloid ships are using the clouds for cover while circling and attacking Mortis Lux and the town.

The party orders some of their ships to patrol higher in the sky and destroy any ships they encounter. Their other ships begin evacuating the town and deploying undead troops to exterminate any Illithids on the ground. 

The party take to the sky to board and destroy the Nautiloids. While aboard one of the Nautiloids, the party fights their way to the control deck shere they find the brain of the Nautiloid itself. Spoops has a crazy idea to take down the Illithids here, and possibly the Emperor himself. Spoops drops his mental defenses and connects his mind to the Illithid hive mind. As he struggles to maintain control over his own mind, Spoops manages to cast Divine Command on the hive mind, ordering all Illithids to kill themselves. He sees visions of Illithids dying, but then melting and reforming into black shadowy versions of themselves. At this moment, he is disconnected from the hive mind as his order is obeyed. 

The party return to the town, unsure of what has become of the Illithids, but assuring the townsfolk that Mortis Lux will defend them.
