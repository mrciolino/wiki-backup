<h1>Witch King's Grand Arcane Focus</h1>
<p>Bane's arcane focus</p>
<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>When the Witch Kings base fell to the Phoenix King, <a href="https://wiki.lowbarbrawlers.com/characters/bane">Bane</a> (then known to the party as the Witch King) trusted us with his revenge. Bane removed his ring and entrusted the party to trick the <a href="https://wiki.lowbarbrawlers.com/characters/Phoenix-King">Phoenix King</a> into putting the ring on, effectively taking over his body. The rest of Bane's armor was confiscated the party, mainly by <a href="https://wiki.lowbarbrawlers.com/characters/bazzdos">Bazzdos</a>.</p>
