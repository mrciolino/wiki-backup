          <p><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Requires Attunement by a Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage roll but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regain 1d8 + 2 charges.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Power Strike: When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Spells: While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: cone of cold (5 charges), fireball (5th-level version, 5 charges), globe of invulnerability (6 charges), hold monster (5 charges), levitate (2 charges). lightning bolt (5th-level version, 5 charges), magic missile (1 charge), ray of enfeeblement (1 charge), or wall of force (5 charges).</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Retributive Strike: You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 x the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Distance from Origin — Damage:</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>10 ft. away or closer — 8 x the number of charges in the staff</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>11 to 20 ft. away — 6 x the number of charges in the staff</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>21 to 30 ft. away — 4 x the number of charges in the staff</p>
