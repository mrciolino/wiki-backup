<p>The Penne-trator Missile system was designed by Bazzdos. It is a long metallic tube piloted by a single spellcaster via a spelljamming helm, and containing ample space for troops. The missile is warded against psychic and magical perception and attack. It is made to move fast. the missile is magically protected against a single forward impact, as it is designed to be rammed full force into the target location before deploying the troops within.</p>
<h1>Origin</h1>
<p>The Penne-trator Missile system was designed by Bazzdos in the last few days leading up to the final battle against the Ithillids. The attack plan required the vanguard to arrive quickly And stealthily at the city on the head of the Ithillid’s beast. To accomplish this, a special spelljammer was created to transport a small but powerful force led by Breezy-e.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After launch, Breezy-e completely forgot where he was supposed to land, and instead rammed somewhere into the back of the creature, near what might be considered a neck, hundreds of miles off course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The missile flown by Breezy-e was destroyed after the obliteration of the Ithillid’s beast.</p>
