<p>Part of a set of magical items, the other item being the <a href="/items/Shield-Ring">Shield Ring</a>. Allows the generation and manipulation of an impenetrable shield.</p>
<h1>Origin</h1>
<p>Part of a set of two magical items found in the tomb of Tiamani the Awesome. The ring was worn by Spoops, and the Shield Generator was used by Os.</p>
<p>This item was surgically and magically implanted on Os Vrntica’s heart during the battle of Fywick. As the rest of the party held off the assault, the lich Ralindu, Freedom, and the Oracle of Fywick performed the procedure to implant the device in Os. Once the device was implanted, Os began his most brilliant performance yet, manifesting the Shield around the city, keeping the waves of monsters at bay while allowing the party and Fywick’s forces to clean up anything inside the barrier. Once Darmuth’s Creature reached the shield, Os managed to keep it at bay long enough for Spoops wearing the Shield Ring to leap spinning into the mouth of the monster, tearing it up from the inside, finishing the fight.</p>

          <p><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Part of a set of magical items, the other item being the <a href="/items/Shield-Ring">Shield Ring</a>. Allows the generation and manipulation of an impenetrable shield. The shield is maintained by the power of the user’s performance. They must use their action to continue performing to maintain the shield. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>When first deploying the shield. The user may choose the shape and size of the shield. However the user must always be inside the shield. By default, the shield is a spherical bubble around the user, if the user manipulates the shape/size, they must do so as if the bubble were stretched and morphed. For example, the shield cannot be spawned &nbsp;around another creature without also including the user, however it can be morphed to encapsulate them so that there is only a small area through which they could escape.</p>
          <p>To maintain or manipulate the shape of the shield, the user must pass Performance checks each turn.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The only way to pass through the shield is by wearing the Shield Ring.<br>&nbsp;</p>
