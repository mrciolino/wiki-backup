          <p>+4 AC, Lightning Resistance, Fire Resistance<br><br>The Mechanical Mirror Shield is a magical item that once the wearer attaches it to their arm provides great defensive properties. The wearer can retract the Mechanical Shield instantly during combat at no cost of an action enabling them to wield 2 handed weapons. The shield has mastered the control of commonly used spells allowing it to manipulate ray attacks including fireball, lightning bolt, and others.</p>
          <p>In addition to deflecting ray attacks, as a reaction when attacked by lightning or fire damage spells, the user can absorb part of the energy into a concentrated beam to redirect it in a direction of their choosing.&nbsp;</p>
