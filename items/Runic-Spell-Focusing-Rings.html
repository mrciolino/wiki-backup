<p>A magical ring with 10 facets on the outside. Each facet is inscribed with magical runes defining a single spell to be cast at a specific spell slot level. The ring can be activated individually, or stacked with other rings and activated as a set. The ring can be activated by a single creature when held, or by attaching a Magical Power Source. Once activated, all spells are channeled into the center of the ring and cast. Stacking the rings stacks allows for the stacking and concurrent casting of the stored spells. Example: Combining a stack of rings enhanced either various spells such as disintegrate, with a magical power source and firing a magical laser unit through the rings will result in a laser combined with the effects of all spells stored in the rings.</p>
<h1>Origin</h1>
<p>The rings were first created by Bazzdows and Spoops &nbsp;looking for a way to enhance their laser beam’s power output. Spoops proposed combining Bazzdows’ technical expertise with his knowledge on Magical Runes. Bazzdows crafted the magical rings and Spoops inscribed them with Disintegrate. They ten tested the rings by firing the laser through them, activating them and adding 10 charges of disintegrate on top of the normal lasers damage. Delighted with the immensely powerful weapon they &nbsp;had just created, they immediately began mass producing the rings in various configurations and sizes.</p>
