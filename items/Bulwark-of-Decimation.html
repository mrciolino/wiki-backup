<h1>Bulwark of Decimation</h1>
<p>A soul forge shield powered by the souls of creatures killed near the shield.</p>
<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>When the Witch Kings base fell to the Phoenix King, <a href="/characters/bane">Bane</a> (then known to the party as the Witch King) trusted us with his revenge. Bane removed his ring and entrusted the party to trick the <a href="/characters/Phoenix-King">Phoenix King</a>, into putting the ring on, effectively taking over his body. The rest of Bane's armor was confiscated the party, mainly <a href="/characters/bazzdos">Bazzdos</a>.</p>
