<p>A mysterious tiara that supposedly contains powers of life and death. Its true purpose was to serve as a vessel for a portion of Spoop's godly powers and memories. Spoops' separated godly persona “Ry-ann” sealed a portion of their memories and power in the tiara where it would wait until, Spoops was ready to re-merge with them.</p>
<h1>Origin</h1>
<p>After Spoops split his being into Ry-ann, and Spoops the Skeleton, he partitioned off part of his power and his earliest memories into the tiara. The tiara has appeared a few times thoughout history, but duing the preparations for Mortis Lux's war against the Ithilids, it was finally acquired by Spoops and merged back into his being, restoring his power and memories once again.</p>
