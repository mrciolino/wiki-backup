<h1>Gilembror's Appeasement</h1>
<p>A cloth glove forged with the help of Gilembror inside of Bazzdos' <a href="/locations/Forge-Dimension">Forge Dimension</a> in the Realm of Fire above a volcano. Worn by <a href="/characters/bazzdos">Bazzdos</a>.</p>
<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>When Bazzdos first received the <a href="https://wiki.lowbarbrawlers.com/locations/Forge-Dimension#ring-of-factory">ring</a> that allowed for travel via door portal to the realm of fire, the stone statue of Gilembror&nbsp;was the first person he met inside. To unlock the power of the forge, Bazzdos had to prove himself a capable worksmith to get the support of Gilembror. The creation of this item was that trail.&nbsp;</p>
