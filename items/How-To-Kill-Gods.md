## The Druid Book

A booked owned by [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) in [Season_1](/Seasons/campaign_1/Season_1).

**How to Kill Gods:**
1. Formulate a plan
1. It is disrespectful to kill an immortal deity without a well-thought-out plan of action
1. Stay up late. One often gets the best or worst ideas when one is on the brink of sleep deprivation and insanity
1. Seek help from others (no, not the therapeutic kind)
1. There are several people that want to kill gods; you are not alone
