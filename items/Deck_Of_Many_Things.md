# The Deck of Many Things
A deck of cards that players may draw from, each one contains a powerful effect either positive or negative. Details for the standard deck are here: https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Deck%20of%20Many%20Things#content

## Custom Cards
Eventually Ryan just got tired of the old deck not being fun enough and decided to add to the randomness by making up new cards on the fly. Thankfully the skilled artist in residence recorded a few of them in his artwork and now we are left to interpret wtf we pulled.
![hourglass.png](/hourglass.png)
An hourglass, perhaps meaning changing an event in time
![chicken.png](/chicken.png)
The card that gave Meade his oft forgotten familiar, a chicken named Gun.

A skull on a purple plane, perhaps an evil book
![eye.png](/deck/eye.png)
I think narascus got this one
![mirror.png](/deck/mirror.png)
A mirror, given to Meade to let him scry on Darmuth.
![rock.png](/deck/rock.png)
Some sort of rock or boulder
![angel1.png](/deck/angel1.png)
An angel of some sort
![blank.png](/deck/blank.png)
I think Ryan ran out of ideas here
![familiar.png](/deck/familiar.png)
Some kind of dog?
![knight.png](/deck/knight.png)
A knight
![question.png](/deck/question.png)
**Vizier**. At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.!
[snake.png](/deck/snake.png)
Ring of Snakes?
![void.png](/deck/void.png)
**The Void**. This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A Wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.![4d.png](/deck/4d.png)
Entering into another dimension
![book.png](/deck/book.png)
A big book called Book
![castle.png](/deck/castle.png)
**Throne**. You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.
![coffin.png](/deck/coffin.png)
Creepy Coffin
![double.png](/deck/double.png)
Some sort of doubling effect
![dragon.png](/deck/dragon.png)
A fire breathing dragon
![happy.png](/deck/happy.png)
A happy angel
![idk.png](/deck/idk.png)
Your guess is as good as mine
![mask.png](/deck/mask.png)
Pretty sure this caused a mask to fuse to Narascus' face
![octopus.png](/deck/octopus.png)
It has 8 limbs so it must be an octopus
![pumpkin.png](/deck/pumpkin.png)
Halloween comes early this year
![ship.png](/deck/ship.png)
A flying ship appears, likely frederinas?
![skull.png](/deck/skull.png)
Not Spoops
![spelljammer.png](/deck/spelljammer.png)
At one point Meade was given knowledge of the Spelljammers
![wings.png](/deck/wings.png)
Wings to fly.
