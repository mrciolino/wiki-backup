# Description and Lore
After besting an Efretti in a drinking contest, Meade was awarded a magical flask from his new genie patron. The flask itself was an ordinary looking silver vessel with a stopper. Meade had his initials "MM" engraved onto the front, as well as the message "Return to Three Swishes, Fywick, for lifetime free drinks" in the event the flask was ever lost.
# Abilities
As an action, you can magically vanish and enter your vessel, which remains in the space you left. The interior of the vessel is an extradimensional space in the shape of a 20-foot-radius cylinder, 20 feet high, and resembles your vessel. The interior is appointed with cushions and low tables and is a comfortable temperature. While inside, you can hear the area around your vessel as if you were in its space. You can remain inside the vessel up to a number of hours equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You exit the vessel early if you use a bonus action to leave, if you die, or if the vessel is destroyed. When you exit the vessel, you appear in the unoccupied space closest to it. Any objects left in the vessel remain there until carried out, and if the vessel is destroyed, every object stored there harmlessly appears in the unoccupied spaces closest to the vessel's former space. Once you enter the vessel, you can't enter again until you finish a long rest.

If the vessel is destroyed or you lose it, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and the previous vessel is destroyed if it still exists. The vessel vanishes in a flare of elemental power when you die.

Meade was able to trap anyone within the flask if they consented to having a drink from him. He used many tricks to entrap people from enemies to unruly bar patrons into agreeing to his drink offers, only to trap them inside. 

# Current Status
After Meade's death, the flask was lost somewhere in Fywick. Given how the original location of the Three Swishes has been buried and built over many years, it is likely somewhere deep in the catacombs of Fywick. It is considered a legendary artifiact due to the legacy of its owner, unique abilities, and because it has been sought after by the Bartender's Guild of Fywick for centuries.
