<p>It is an hourglass counting down to a particular event. The hourglass was counting down to the destruction of Mardun.</p>
<h1>Origin</h1>
<p>The hourglass was obtained by Breezy-e using a card from the deck of many things. The event the hourglass was counting down to remained a mystery until the end of campaign 1 when it seemed to be extremely close to running out as the Ithillid Invasion of Mardun began.</p>
