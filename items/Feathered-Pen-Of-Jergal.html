<p>The pen of Jergal was used by Jergal to do much of his accounting and documentation of all that occurs in the universe. It is empowered with reality altering abilities. The user can write things into existence, although something cannot be created from nothing.</p>
<h1>Origin</h1>
<p>The feathered Pen of Jergal. Obtained by Spoops after signing some documents during a meeting with Jergal in Jergal’s divine realm. Spoops accidentally took the pen with him, when he asked Jergal if he wanted it back, Jergal said to hold on to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spoops later used the Pen to acquire materials to reinforce the imprisonment of Carceri from across the planes and store them in Mortis Lux Castle.</p>
<p>Spoops also used the pen to acquire some of his own blood to use as ink, and sign the treaty between The Council of Gods and Mortis Lux.</p>

          <p>The pen is empowered with reality altering abilities. The user can write things into existence, although something cannot be created from nothing.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Example: If the user writes “A pile of diamonds appears in front of me” the diamonds will be acquired in the simplest way, they may be taken from a bank, or a nearby necklace, etc. Also the amount of diamonds may vary from one into to ridiculously large, etc. The user must be reasonably specific when using the pen.</p>
