# Bone of Ry-ann's First Undead
An ancient bone fragment from the first undead creature ever raised by [Ry-ann](/characters/spoops).


## Hastow Cathedral
The bone was taken by [Spoops](/characters/spoops) from the [Hastow](/locations/Mardun/Hastow) cathedral after it [grew legs and started walking around](/Events/return-to-hastow).
