<p>A fragment of Spoops' Divine power. This blade is a part of Spoops very being. The blade itself or a copy can be granted to another by Spoops' will.</p>
<h1>Origin</h1>
<p>The Shard of Divinity was forged over the course of 15,000 years in various time-dilated chambers, by reforging multiple powerful blades gathered and forged by Spoops and Bazzdos into a single ultimate weapon while fusing this new blade with Spoops himself.</p>
