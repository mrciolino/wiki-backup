          <p>(Warforged Only)<br>Finesse weapon with a melee attack, ranged attack, and utility</p>
          <p>These gauntlets are made from the finest metals in the world. They are bespoke with lots of complex gearing, capacitors, sensors and autonomous control. They have small antennas in them that are able to be remotely controlled. Works with extra attacks.</p>
          <p>(Improved Gauntlets Void the Following Paragraph)The gauntlets have Artificial Intelligence which while uses a lot of energy can be sustained for a short period of time. When these gauntlets are used as an action, the user must recharge the gauntlets using one action. You can use the gauntlets' reserve batteries to use the gauntlets for two actions in a row, but, will cause damage to the gauntlets which will not work unless repaired for 10 minutes.</p>
          <p><strong>Ranged Attack</strong> - Intelligence +3 to hit<br>The gauntlet is launched off the user's hands into the air. The gauntlets contain four sections, each with its own small rocket engine. Each section can be controlled separately or as part of a group. Each section can be used kinetically to impact a creature. When done so, each section will impact with 4d6+INT bludgeoning damage. Since their antennas are small they can only reach out to a range of 90/180 feet.</p>
          <p><strong>Melee Attack</strong> - Strength +3 to hit<br>Instead of being launched off the user. Just the rocket engines extend from the gauntlets allowing them to propel the fists of the user at the target within 5 ft. Each gauntlet carries significant force doing 8d8+STR bludgeoning damage and knocking back the target/s 5 feet. They make a dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone from the hit.</p>
          <p><strong>Utility +3</strong> ability check<br>The user can also use the gauntlets for regular needs, controlling them "fly-by-wire" assisted by the AI. The gauntlets have a movement of 80 fly feet when used this way. The 4 sections can carry up to 25 lbs each.</p>
