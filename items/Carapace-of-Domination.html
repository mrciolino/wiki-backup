<h1>Carapace of Domination</h1>
<p>The plate armor of Bane.</p>
<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>When the Witch Kings base fell to the Phoenix King, <a href="https://wiki.lowbarbrawlers.com/characters/bane">Bane</a> (then known to the party as the Witch King) trusted us with his revenge. Bane removed his ring and entrusted the party to trick the <a href="https://wiki.lowbarbrawlers.com/characters/Phoenix-King">Phoenix King</a>, into putting the ring on, effectively taking over his body. The rest of Bane's armor was confiscated the party, mainly <a href="https://wiki.lowbarbrawlers.com/characters/bazzdos">Bazzdos</a>.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;AC 21 resistance to magical bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing, +4 to your consituition, prevents any clothing, armor, weapons, or anyother item on your body from being removed against your will,</p>
          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;you gain the ability to make a creature unaware of your magical influence on it. When you cast an enchantment spell to charm one or more creatures, you can alter one creature's understanding so that it remains unaware of being charmed.</p>
          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can use your action to try to make the chosen creature forget some of the time it spent charmed. The creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). &nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;You can make the creature forget less time, and the amount of time can't exceed the duration of your enchantment spell.</p>
