<h2>The Disjunction of Godsbane</h2>
<p>Season 4 | July 1st 2024</p>
<p>In an attempt to destory Ceric from the blade, Bazzdos decided to cast Mordenkainen's Disjunction on it. To prempt with choatic manuver, we activated an anti-magic field to contain the magic from the blade. The disjunction actually released Bhaal, not Ceric, from the blade, and we made a deal to kill Ceric with the help of Bhaal. The remaining magic in the air was quickly seized by <a href="/characters/spoops">Spoops</a>, <a href="/characters/bazzdos">Bazzdos</a>, and Bhaal in an athletics contest, which involved multiple triple-digit athletic rolls.</p>
