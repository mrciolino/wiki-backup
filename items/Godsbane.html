<h1>Godsbane</h1>
<p>Sword</p>
<h2>The Disjunction of Godsbane</h2>
<p>Season 4 | July 1st 2024</p>
<p>In an attempt to destroy Ceric in the blade, Bazzdos decided to cast <a href="/Spells/Mordekainen's-Disjunction">Mordenkainen's Disjunction</a> on it. To prompt this chaotic maneuver, we activated an anti-magic field to contain any magic that would come from the blade. The disjunction actually released Bhaal, not Ceric, from the blade, and we made a deal to kill Ceric with the help of Bhaal. The remaining magic in the air was quickly seized by <a href="/characters/spoops">Spoops</a>, <a href="/characters/bazzdos">Bazzdos</a>, and Bhaal in an athletics contest, which involved multiple triple-digit athletic rolls.</p>

          <p><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Godsbane the blade of Cyric, that which struck down Bhaal in the times of Trouble before the second sundering. A Crimson red blade which yearns for the souls of its wielder's enemies which it consumes through partaking of their blood. A bloodthirsty creation so debauched in violence and slaughter that the very gods themselves fear its sting.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Those who have felt Godsbane's sting become even more vulnerable to additional strikes from the blade</p>
