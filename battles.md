## Glub Glub
###### June 3rd, 2024
After Bazzdos decieded to explore Spoops' leather bag stomach (that he picked up early in the campaing) while Spoops "went big" (2^10 Enlarge), he found a portal to the elemental plane of water. On the other side of the portal Glub Glub showed himself and was able to dominate person Bazzdos. Glub Glub used this opprunity to create not only speaking stone enchjanced steel armour for his crab army but also decided to use bassdos' expiermental laser lens. Bazzdos crafted all of these items in his forge plane and was able to convert the laser lens to be used with a lightning rod.

The party after relasing bazzdos hasnt been around for a while decided to go visit bazzdos in the forge dimension and asked him what he was doing. He told the party in good faith that glub glub (an enemy of spoops) employed his help to forge magical items for glub glubs army. The party relized that this Bazzdos was dominated and casted a cantrip on him to break him out of the spell. The party deciceded that we should retrieved the laser lens tech back from glub glub and proceeded to leave the forge dimension to go back into the elemental plane of fire.

They open the door and a laser attacj from glub glubs claw come right at them. Spoops is able to use his mechincal mirror sheild to redirect the attack the the appendege the laser is attached to, dropping it to the ground.
