### Battles

#### **Glub Glub**
**June 3rd, 2024 | Season 4**  
After Bazzdos explored Spoops' leather bag stomach, he discovered a portal to the [Elemental Plane of Water](/planes/elemental-plane-of-water). Glub Glub appeared and used Dominate Person on Bazzdos, forcing him to craft enchanted steel armor for his crab army. Bazzdos also converted an experimental laser lens for use with a lightning rod. After breaking the spell, the party retrieved the laser lens from Glub Glub and returned to the [Elemental Plane of Fire](/planes/elemental-plane-of-fire). Spoops redirected Glub Glub’s laser attack, severing his claw, but Glub Glub’s multiple parts began regenerating, forcing the party to retreat.

#### **Darmuth**  
Reveal of the brain, Os' teleportation into lava, and a wish.

#### **Rathwing**  
Bomb the bear, death by an arrow through the eye.

#### **Dragon Turtle**  
Escape with gust of wind; raided the horde.

#### **Fywick Bone Monstrosity**  
A 50-foot-tall creature made of bone, resembling a bone devil.  
The party discovered an underground ritual site with red blood roots beneath [Fort Suro](/locations/mardun/fort-suro). Drawing from the [Deck of Many Things](/artifacts/deck-of-many-things), Drakham turned purple, [Breezy](/characters/breezy) went blind but gained thermal vision, and Spoops acquired “free real estate.”
[Darmuth](/characters/darmuth) sent her pet after them, forcing the party to flee. They called [Kat](/characters/kat) to bring down the flying ship. In [Fywick](/locations/mardun/fywick), they sought out the Oracle. [Tony Mozzarella](/characters/tony-mozzarella)'s actions secured a meeting with the Goliath Oracle, who directed them to [Ashelf](/characters/ashelf)'s homeland and the [Fortress of Tiamat](/locations/fortress-of-tiamat).

The battle against the bone devil began with Fywick’s army defending the bay and sea gate. Os received a heart-implanted shield generator from [Rolinduo](/characters/rolinduo). Federina betrayed the party, causing the shield to fail, allowing the bone devil inside. Spoops wielded [Inferno’s Greatsword](/weapons/infernos-greatsword), [Earth Terror](/weapons/earth-terror), and the [Goose Dagger](/weapons/goose-dagger), declaring, “Peace was never an option.” He was gravely injured but killed the bone devil from the inside. [Naracuss](/characters/naracuss) later attached a knife as Spoops’ new leg with [sovereign glue](/artifacts/sovereign-glue).

#### **Alford**  
Inferno’s destruction, Drakham’s spider potion, and a pirate raid.

#### **Krogs Hometown Ithilid Assault**  
The [Ithilid](/factions/ithilid) launched an assault with their space laser, leading to the downfall of the mech [Tarrasque](/creatures/tarrasque).

#### **Bar Brawl (The First Fight)**  
The party earned their name in this chaotic fight. Lucina was summoned, and Otto Hertzog hunted Os.

#### **Guardison's Quest (Goblin Cave)**  
Details unknown.

#### **Kaltrazar Bay Burning (Prison)**  
The party was imprisoned. In their escape, they burned down the town.

#### **Final Fight**  
After months of preparation, [Mortis Lux](/factions/mortis-lux) assembled its forces for the ultimate battle against the Ithilid threat.

**Forces:**  
- Hundreds of thousands of undead (zombies, skeletons, wights).  
- Over 1,000 space-faring ships powered by magical gems (quartz, sapphire, ruby).  
- Divine support from [Odin](/characters/odin), [Thor](/characters/thor), and [Loki](/characters/loki).  
- Preparations included:
  - [Spider Queen](/characters/spider-queen) involvement.  
  - Training all troops.  
  - Time chamber session for laser enhancements.  
  - Spoops’ blade improvement.  
  - [Gith](/factions/gith) potions.  

**The Battle:**  
After Spoops’ speech, Mortis Lux faced simultaneous Ithilid attacks on Fywick, [Kaltrazar Bay](/locations/mardun/kaltrazar-bay), and [Gothrithon](/locations/gothrithon). They launched an assault on the Ithilid homeworld, a massive, moon-sized flesh creature, in three phases:
1. Vanguard squad to establish a foothold.  
2. Support wave.  
3. **[PLAN TO BE FILLED IN]**  

The vanguard squad, led by Breezy E, landed in an uncharted area and encountered [Krorgfrey](/characters/krorgfrey), who led them to **[NEXT LOCATION TO BE FILLED IN]**.
