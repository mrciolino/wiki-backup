### Battles

#### **Glub Glub**
**June 3rd, 2024 | Season 4**  
After Bazzdos decided to explore Spoops' leather bag stomach (which he picked up early in the campaign) while Spoops "went big" (using a 2^10 Enlarge spell), he discovered a portal to the Elemental Plane of Water. On the other side, Glub Glub appeared and used Dominate Person on Bazzdos. Glub Glub seized this opportunity to have Bazzdos create enchanted steel armor for his crab army and adapt Bazzdos' experimental laser lens. In his forge plane, Bazzdos converted the laser lens to be used with a lightning rod.  
After releasing Bazzdos, who had been absent for a while, the party decided to visit him in the forge dimension to check on his activities. Bazzdos confessed that Glub Glub, an enemy of Spoops, had compelled him to forge magical items for Glub Glub's army. Realizing that Bazzdos was dominated, the party used a cantrip to break the spell. They decided to retrieve the laser lens technology from Glub Glub and proceeded to leave the forge dimension, heading back to the Elemental Plane of Fire.  
As they opened the door, they were met with a laser attack from Glub Glub's claw. Spoops used his mechanical mirror shield to redirect the attack back at the appendage, severing it. A fierce battle ensued: Spoops enlarged himself, Adayln cast an apocalyptic storm, Bazzdos was banished to a Windows XP-themed plane, and Breezy unleashed a spaghetti attack. Though they defeated the main Glub Glub, his multiple parts (34 in total) began to regenerate. The party decided to take the laser and leave.  
**Miscellaneous:** The space laser was created and tested. FTW!

#### **Darmuth**  
Reveal of the brain and Os' teleportation into lava and the wish.

#### **Rathwing**  
Bomb the bear, death by an arrow through the eye.

#### **Dragon Turtle**  
Escape with gust of wind; raided the horde.

#### **Fywick Bone Monstrosity**  
A 50-foot-tall creature made of bone (bone devil-like in appearance).  
The party discovered an underground ritual site with red blood roots beneath Fort Suro. During this time, they drew from the Deck of Many Things, resulting in Drakham turning purple, Breezy going blind but gaining thermal vision, and Spoops getting "free real estate."  
Darmuth became aware of the party and sent her pet after them. They traveled in an armored carriage (obtained from Illiard's cousin in Kaltrazar Bay) westward. Spotting the bone devil in the distance, they attempted to flee and called Kat to bring down the flying ship, leaving the carriage behind.  
Upon arriving in Fywick, they sought out the Oracle. *Tony Mozzarella's* questionable actions got them a meeting with the Goliath Oracle, who provided key intel on Darmuth, directing them to Ashelf's homeland and the Fortress of Tiamat.  
For the battle against the bone devil, Fywick's army prepared defenses along the bay and a sea gate. Os underwent a risky surgery by Rolinduo to install a shield generator in his heart. As the battle began, Federina betrayed the party, causing the shield to fail and allowing the bone devil inside.  
Spoops, wielding Inferno’s Greatsword, Earth Terror, and the Goose Dagger in his mouth, declared, “Peace was never an option.” In the fight, the bone devil bit off Spoops’ leg. Spoops retaliated by storming into its throat, unleashing a sword tornado, and killing it from the inside. The party retrieved Spoops' burned and injured body, and Naracuss used sovereign glue to attach a knife as his new leg.

#### **Alford**  
Inferno's destruction, Drakham's spider potion, and the pirate raid.

#### **Krogs Hometown Ithilid Assault**  
The Ithilid launched an assault with their space laser, leading to the downfall of the mech tarrasque.

#### **Bar Brawl (The First Fight)**  
This is where the party earned their name. Lucina was summoned, and Otto Hertzog hunted Os. The rest of the party joined the chaotic brawl.

#### **Guardison's Quest (Goblin Cave)**  
Details unknown.

#### **Kaltrazar Bay Burning (Prison)**  
The party was imprisoned. In their escape, they burned down the town.

#### **Final Fight**  
After months of preparation and discussions with the Council of the Gods, Mortis Lux assembled its forces for the ultimate battle against the Ithilid threat.

**Forces:**
- Hundreds of thousands of undead: zombies, skeletons, and wights.
- Over 1,000 space-faring ships powered by magical gems (quartz, sapphire, ruby) for speed, defense, and weaponry.
- Divine support from Odin, Thor, and Loki.
- Preparations included:
  - Spider Queen involvement.
  - Training all troops (list pending).
  - Time chamber session for laser enhancements.
  - Spoops' blade improvement.
  - Gith potions.

**The Battle:**  
After an inspirational speech from Spoops, the final day arrived. Calls from speaking stones reported simultaneous attacks on Fywick, Kaltrazar Bay, and Gothrithon. Mortis Lux dispatched 20 ships to each city to fend off Tectechanlls and Dreadnaughts emerging from sky cracks.  
To go on the offensive, Mortis Lux launched an assault on the Ithilid homeworld—a massive, moon-sized flesh creature. The attack had three phases:
1. A vanguard squad to establish a foothold.
2. A support wave.  
3. **[PLAN TO BE FILLED IN]**  

The vanguard squad, led by Breezy E, was deployed but landed in an uncharted area. They encountered Krorgfrey, who, after some interrogation, led them to **[NEXT LOCATION TO BE FILLED IN]**.
