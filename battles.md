## Glub Glub
###### June 3rd, 2024 | Season 4
After Bazzdos decided to explore Spoops' leather bag stomach (which he picked up early in the campaign) while Spoops "went big" (using a 2^10 Enlarge spell), he discovered a portal to the Elemental Plane of Water. On the other side, Glub Glub appeared and used Dominate Person on Bazzdos. Glub Glub seized this opportunity to have Bazzdos create enchanted steel armor for his crab army and adapt Bazzdos' experimental laser lens. In his forge plane, Bazzdos converted the laser lens to be used with a lightning rod.

After releasing Bazzdos, who had been absent for a while, the party decided to visit him in the forge dimension to check on his activities. Bazzdos confessed that Glub Glub, an enemy of Spoops, had compelled him to forge magical items for Glub Glub's army. Realizing that Bazzdos was dominated, the party used a cantrip to break the spell. They decided to retrieve the laser lens technology from Glub Glub and proceeded to leave the forge dimension, heading back to the Elemental Plane of Fire.

As they opened the door, they were met with a laser attack from Glub Glub's claw. Spoops used his mechanical mirror shield to redirect the attack back at the appendage, severing it. A fierce battle ensued: Spoops enlarged himself, Adayln cast an apocalyptic storm, Bazzdos was banished to a Windows XP-themed plane, and Breezy unleashed a spaghetti attack. Though they defeated the main Glub Glub, his multiple parts (34 in total) began to regenerate. The party decided to take the laser and leave.

Miscellaneous: The space laser was created and tested. FTW!
