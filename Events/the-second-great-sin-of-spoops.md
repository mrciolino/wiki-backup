# The Second Great Sin of Spoops
In his desperation for power after being humiliated and slain, [Spoops](/characters/spoops) sought methods to quickly acquire power which led him to commit shameful sins.

## The Owl Bear Blender
Spoops asks [Os](/characters/os) to go to with him to the astral plane and Spoops uses the 12th level spell: [Seed Life](/Spells/Seed-Life) to spawn two planets worth of Owlbears which Os gathers into a bowl using his shield. Spoops casts [Soul Absorption](/Spells/Soul-Absorption) to harvest their power and distribute it among the party, granting them Epic Boons.
