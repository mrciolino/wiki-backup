# The Ice Castle of Bahryst
The party travels to the city of Bahryst to investigate the castle Spoops was granted by the deck of many things. Upon arrival they discover the castle has been tsken over by an evil wizard named Fiad. 

The party meets Tamara Strenger, another member of thr Guardison family.

## The Lycanthropy Problem and Start of Spoops' Paladin Order
When the party found out from the innkeeper that there was an outbreak of lycanthropy in the city, and the townsfolk were being oppressed by the wizard Fiad who recently took over the castle, the party rallied the townsfolk around the filthy fountain in the middle of town, where Spoops made a proposal. Spoops displayed his Paladin power by purifying and blessing the polluted water from the fountain and using the new Holy Water to cure one of the lycanthropes. Then he called out to the crowd looking for new recruits to worship and train under him, it was Kierkegaard who was first to volunteer. A few other citizens stepped forward to become paladins, namely Ghazali, Niebhur, Tilich, Luther, and Wolterstoff. Spoops trained them in the basics and together they permanantly purified the cities water.

## Investigating the Castle
The party then goes to inflitrate the castle. They find the castle to be heavily guarded with magical traps and illusions. Spoops takes a turn into s room alone and finds himself trapped within nester illusions. After activating his Anti-magic armor he begins breaking out of the illusions at which point he finds he has been captured and restrained to a chair within a prison cell in the dungeon. With his armor activated he uses his knife leg and brute force to get out of his cell and retrieve the rest of his weapons. Spoops then flies through the bone devil infested dungeon to rejoin the party. After the party departed the city, Kierkegaard led the newly formed paladin order in training, cleansing sickness and death, recruitment, as well as running the affairs of the city now that Fiad was defeated and Spoops was away.
