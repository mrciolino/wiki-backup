# Capturing Mecha-Tarrasque
The party goes to the Library Dimension.


## Breezy-E Smokes Some Js
Breezy-E starts tearing pages out of some books, and using them to roll joints. Sharing with Os.


## The Two Tarrasques
The party encounters two tarrasques fighting in a cave. A robotic tarasque and another one. They begin fighting the tarrasques and intending to capture the robotic one, Bazzdos yells at the party not to kill his new robot pet.

Spoops uses his Ring of Magnificent size to grow to maximum size, then he attacks the tarasques. He absolutely obliterates the first tarrasque.

Bazzdos uses his magical knowledge and technical expertise to analyze the source code of the Mecha-Tarrasque, allowing him to capture and tame it.

Bazzdos uses his ring of enlightenment to cast awaken on the Mecha-Tarrasque.
