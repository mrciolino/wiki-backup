# Exploring The Ancient Sunken Elven City
The party delves below the ocean to explore an ancient elven city that may contain valuable treasures.

## Exploring The Castle.
The party explore the city castle,
seeking treasures of this old high elf kingdom. They fight many enemies along the way.


## Arrival To The Throne Room
Just before entering the throne room, The Witch King arrives saying hell help them out. The party doesnt particularly want hos help as they dont trust him, but he just laughs and joins anyway.


## Jormungandr's Prison
The party arrive in the throne room where they see a massive ball of energy above a pedestal. Here Jormungandr is sealed away. Spoops uses his blade, The Cleanser, to break the seal, and at the same time, he Soul Steals the serpent. Spoops is overcome with memories and has flashbacks to his time living among the people here, and remembers how he had initially sealed Jormungandr here to put an end to Glub Glub's invasion. The party engages Jormungandr, attempting to subdue him as he thrashes about, resisting the Soul Steal. Spoops then successfully Soul Steals Joungandr, as he prys Jormungandr's soul out with all his might. Needing a vessel to hold the soul, The Witch King gifts Spoops a diamond inscribed with various magical runes to create a soul prison. Spoops seals Jormungandr's soul within the Diamond and uses soverign glue to attach the diamond to the front of his spine. The party uses rathwing's memory device to play out the visions and memories Spoops saw.


## Return to The Surface
The party returns to the surface without the witch king where they take the belt back from Spoops and fill him in on what happened.
