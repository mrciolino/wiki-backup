# The Death of Krorg
Just as [Altricia](/locations/Mardun/Allford) comes into view from their ship, the party witnesses the fall of the city and hears the death of [Krorg](/characters/krorg). 


## Darmuth Invades Altricia
[Darmuth](/characters/Darmuth) is let into Altricia by a secret anti-Krorg coalition run by [Queen Kayla](/characters/queen-kayla). Breaking her promise to Kayla, Darmuth then lays waste to Altricia. Kayla escapes with her son [Krorgfrey](/characters/krorgfrey) and Krorg's bodyguard [Knott Em'Portent](/characters/knott-emportent) back to [Krorg's Hometown](/locations/Mardun/north_geskoworm), but she dies on the voyage.

## The Party Hears Krorg Die
The party's ship approaches Altricia only to see it engulfed in flames. They contact Krorg via speaking stone while he is in combat against Darmuth. Krorg puts up a fight but ends up eaten by [Darmuth's enormous bone dragon pet](/characters/carl). The party hears him die as they witness the destruction of Altricia. 


## Fleeing Across The Dragon Sea
Unable to face such a powerful enemy as they are now, they flee across the sea landing at the [shrine of torment](/locations/Mardun/shrine-of-torment) before traveling by carriage to [Kaltrosar Bay](/locations/Mardun/Kaltrosar).
