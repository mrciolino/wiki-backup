# The Death of Krorg
Just as Altricia comes into view from their ship, the party witnesses the fall of the city and hears the death of Krorg. 


## Darmuth Invades Altricia
Darmuth is let into Altricia by a secret anti-Krorg coalition run by Queen Kayla. Breaking her promise to Kayla, Darmuth then lays waste to Altricia. Kayla escapes with her son Krorgfrey and Krorg's bodyguard Knott Em'Portent back to [Krorg's Hometown](/locations/Mardun/north_geskoworm), but she dies on the voyage.

## The Party Hears Krorg Die
The party's ship approaches Altricia only to see it engulfed in flames. They contact Krorg via speaking stone while he is in combat against Darmuth. Krorg puts up a fight but ends up eaten by Darmuth's enormous bone dragon pet. The party hears him die as they witness the destruction of Altricia. 


## Fleeing Across The Dragon Sea
Unable to face such a powerful enemy as they are now, they flee across the sea landing at the shrine of torment before traveling by carriage to Kaltrosar Bay.
