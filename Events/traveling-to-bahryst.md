# Traveling to Bahryst
The party travels to [Bahryst](/locations/Mardun/bahryst) in their flying ship. They make a few stops along the way.


## Searching for Treasure
The party has since gone in search of promised treasures and prizes, A first attempt by [Os](/characters/os) to teleport to a previous location with the party failed, and the group ended up on a somewhat familiar island. [Spoops](/characters/spoops) and [Bazvrah](/characters/Bazvrah) met a female T-rex they attempted to flirt with until an ancient red dragon showed up, angry at being awakened and forced a retreat... but not before Os was inspired to become its friend. 

Spoops would discover a dragon charm ring, which he gave to Os.


## Elon Musk
The party stops at a beach on the way to Bahryst. Here they meet [Elon Tusk](/characters/elon-tusk). Bazvrah asks Elon for future technology but Musk says no; Bazvrah tries to steal his polyester suit thinking that could lead to developments in new materials. Elon takes offense to this and disappears from the world.

Spoops also completes the resurrection of the undead unicorn, releasing it into the wild.
