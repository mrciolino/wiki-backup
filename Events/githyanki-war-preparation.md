# Githyanki War Preparation
Spoops and Adalynn are brought before Vlaakith while looking for allies to join Mortis Lux. Vlaakith makes a counter offer, she will help fight Illithids if Mortis Lux serves her. Upon Spoops and Adalynn's refusal, Vlaakith tries to subjugate them but they are able to resist via anti-magic armor. Spoops attempts to display his power to Vlaakith by casting raise dead at 10th level on the enirety of Tu'narath (the six armed dead titan corpse on which Vlaakith's city is built) he spell fails and Vlaakith laughs at Spoops' "paltry" power. Spoops takes offense and swears revenge. They use the anti-magic armor and teleport away before Vlaakith can hold them captive any longer.

Vlaakith gives the party a warning to reconsider her offer.




## Two months of Preparations

After an eventful few days, the party return to Wegate to spend two months preparing for war. 

During the preparations Spoops and Bazzdos go into the second time chamber. Creating the Shard of Divinity, and training Spoops' new divine powers.

During the two months, Spoops uses the corpses gathered by his followers and undead to raise an army of hundreds of thousands of Undead soldiers. 

The Wegatian shipyard constructs a few hundred more spelljammer warships equipped with crystal powered weaponry. Pilots are recruited from the ranks of the Wizards of Porthy, and Highhold, the Clerics of Wegate, Clerics of Hastow, and Pirates of Saragossa.
