# Githyanki War Preparation
The party spend two months making final preparations for their attack on [Vlaakith](/characters/vlaakith).



## Two months of Preparations

After an eventful few days, the party return to [Wegate](/locations/Mardun/Wegate) to spend two months preparing for war. 


## Infinite Undead Army
During the two months, [Spoops](/characters/spoops) uses the corpses gathered by his followers and undead to raise an army of hundreds of thousands of Undead soldiers. The army is primarily composed of Wights and Heavy Armored Skeletons. Each Wight raises and controls a squad of 6 Heavy Skeletons.


## Constructing The Spelljammer Fleet
The [Wegatian shipyard](/locations/Mardun/the-great-port-of-wegate) constructs a few hundred more spelljammer warships equipped with crystal powered weaponry. Pilots are recruited from the ranks of the Wizards of Porthy, and Highhold, the Clerics of Wegate, Clerics of Hastow, and Pirates of Saragossa. The deck of each ship is equipped with magical cannons, manned by [Mortis Lux](/organizations/mortis-lux) soldiers, the spelljammer helm, piloted by a magic caster, and multiple squads of living and undead Mortis Lux soldiers. The hull of the ships are specially designed to hold over 400 undead troops. The front of the ships can fully open to create a ramp, allowing the entire regiment of undead to march out of the ship.


## Magical Surfboards
[Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos) creates magical spelljammer surfboards for the party. The higher the spell level used to power the surfboard, the faster they travel. Upon touching his board, Spoops saw a vision of himself using a 12th level spell slot to ride the board. In this vision, he went so fast that in an instant he collided with and shattered the cracked crystal sphere around [Mardun](/locations/Mardun), allowing the [Emperor](/characters/Emperor) and his creature to invade. Luckily it was just a dream. However he does accidentally use a higher level spell slot and crash into the Great Port of Wegate, taking out some ships and docks. He deploys more undead labor to fix what he broke.
