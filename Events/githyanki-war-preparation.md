# Githyanki War Preparation
Spoops and Adalynn are brought before Vlaakith while looking for allies to join Mortis Lux. Vlaakith makes a counter offer, she will help fight Illithids if Mortis Lux serves her. Upon Spoops and Adalynn's refusal, Vlaakith tries to subjugate them but they are able to resist via anti-magic armor. Spoops attempts to display his power to Vlaakith by casting raise dead at 10th level on the enirety of Tu'narath (the six armed dead titan corpse on which Vlaakith's city is built) he spell fails and Vlaakith laughs at Spoops' "paltry" power. Spoops takes offense and swears revenge. They use the anti-magic armor and teleport away before Vlaakith can hold them captive any longer.

Vlaakith gives the party two months to reconsider her offer.

## Zeus vs. Spoops Brought to you by Bazzdos
While Spoops and Adalynn were with Vlaakith, Bazzdos was investigating thr assassination note mountain in the Library dimension. Bazzdos finds an assassination note from someone seeking combat with Spoops. He proceeds to work with a lawyer in the library to set up a fight between Zeus and Spoops.

### Spoops and Zeus fight 1v1: 
Spoops grts roped into the fight against Zeus who is wants revenge for the crashing of Bombcoin. Spoops throws everything he has at Zeus but cant even scratch him. He is able to drag Zeus through the far realms by drinking a Protein Shake of Power. This greatly affects Zeus' mind, and Spoops took the opportunity to use his 12th level spell: The Banhammer. However to Spoops' surprise the hammer has no effect on Zeus. Instead Zeus grabs the hammer amd smashes Spoops into the ground, killing him. Spoops resurrects and sneaks away through the well of many worlds. He is able to then contact Adalynn for a portal home.



## Quest for Power
After being humiliated and slain, Spoops gets desperate for more strength. He puts all his focus on acquiring more power quickly. This leads him to commit his [Two Great Sins] (/Events/the-great-sins-of-spoops).

## The Great Port of Wegate and Infinite Undead Army
Mortis Lux constructs the Great Port of Wegate and begins mass producing Spelljammer warships. Spoops commands Wegate and his Paladins to scour the surrounding areas for corpses.


## Selune's Gathering
Os is invited to a gathering in Selune's divine realm to discuss the Spoops problem. The party go to Selune's divine realm, Spoops is convincingly disguised as "Spencer". 

Spoops, Adalynn, and Elira are caught looking for powerful magic in Selune's library by Selune herself. Spoops deflects Selune's moonbeam attacks and eacapes to another planet. They find themselves on a floating island kingdom inhabited by half-dragon people ruled by Faaspraanaam (child of Bahamut and Tiamat) through the Well of Many Worlds with Elira.

Os Adalynn and Bazzdows are brought before the Goddess Selune. Os is confronted by a furious Selune who is trying to convince him to turn against and destroy Spoops and ascend to godhood, joining the pantheon. Os is able to convince her anr Bahamut to give him one last chance to convince Spoops not to ascend to godhood. Selune accepts and grants Os power and allows him to ascend to join the pantheon as a new demigod under herself and her daughter Sune.


## Spoops' Ascention 
After landing in the floating island kingdom with half dragon people Spoops goes to meet the locals and see what's the deal with this place.

Then Bazzdows, Adalynn, and Os are sent to the floating island dragon kingdom where Spoops and Elira are currently. 

The party reunites in front of the gates to the castle where Spoops is praying to His Divine Self Ry-ann and uses the 12th level spell Divine Command on himself to re-merge his split being into one.

Then the party is wuickly presented by some guards before Faaspraanaam a huge double headed Purple Dragon, apparently the son of Bahamut and Tiamat. After some questioning Faaspraanaam's initial hostility subsides after the party agrees to leave, and so they do without any further incidents.

Before departing, Os tells Spoops that to make peace with the Gods, they want him to cease any attempts to ascend. Spoops tells Os its too late because he just ascended 5 minutes ago. The party then returns back to Mardun.



## Two months of Preparations

After an eventful few days, the party return to Wegate to spend two months preparing for war. 

During the preparations Spoops and Bazzdos go into the second time chamber. Creating the Shard of Divinity.

During the two months, Spoops uses the hundreds os thiusands of corpses gathered by his followers and undead to raise an army of hundreds of thousands of Undead soldiers. 

The Wegatian shipyard constructs a few hundred more spelljammer warships equipped with crystal powered weaponry. Pilots are recruited from the ranks of the Wizards of Porthy, and Highhold, the Clerics of Wegate, Clerics of Hastow, and Pirates of Saragossa.
