# Githyanki War Preparation
Spoops and Adalynn are brought before Vlaakith while looking for allies to join Mortis Lux. Vlaakith makes a counter offer, she will help fight Illithids if Mortis Lux serves her. Upon Spoops and Adalynn's refusal, Vlaakith tries to subjugate them but they are able to resist via anti-magic armor. Spoops attempts to display his power to Vlaakith by casting raise dead at 10th level on the enirety of Tu'narath (the six armed dead titan corpse on which Vlaakith's city is built) he spell fails and Vlaakith laughs at Spoops' "paltry" power. Spoops takes offense and swears revenge. They use the anti-magic armor and teleport away before Vlaakith can hold them captive any longer.

Vlaakith gives the party a warning to reconsider her offer.




## Two months of Preparations

After an eventful few days, the party return to Wegate to spend two months preparing for war. 


## The Second Time Chamber
During the preparations Spoops and Bazzdos go into the second time chamber. Creating the Shard of Divinity, and training Spoops' new divine powers.
A Second Time Chamber is enabled by Spoops casting his last remaining wish obtained earlier from the Deck of Many Things.
The Wish: "I wish for the time for bazzdows, Spoops, and Adalynn, to complete the following tasks to be accelerated within Bazzdows' Forge demiplane such that only one week passes in the material plane. The tasks are as follows: combine these two swords, the Spoops Blade, and the Titanite Blade, Craft the ring of magnificent size, create two spells of 10th level, one spell of 11th level, one spell of 12th level, upgrade the Mirror Shild into the Mechanical Mirror Shield, Sanctify the Titanite Blade, Enchant the Titanite Blade with the ability to sap the soul of its victims, adding an enemies health into Spoops's own temporary HP, including 1000 years to experiment with and train Spoop's god abilities, create magical surfboard spelljammers for each of the current members of the Low Bar Brawlers, including time for Bazzdows to study and learn 3rd level Counterspell, 5th level Far Step, 5th level Magic Jar, 7th Level Teleport, 8th level clone, 9th Foresight, Create the Ring of Mind Shilding, Create a Headband of Intellect, create a magical spelljammer battleship, improvements to Bazzdows' rocket gauntlets."


## Infinite Undead Army
During the two months, Spoops uses the corpses gathered by his followers and undead to raise an army of hundreds of thousands of Undead soldiers. The army is primarily composed of Wights and Heavy Armored Skeletons. Each Wight raises and controls a squad of 6 Heavy Skeletons.


## Constructing The Spelljammer Fleet
The Wegatian shipyard constructs a few hundred more spelljammer warships equipped with crystal powered weaponry. Pilots are recruited from the ranks of the Wizards of Porthy, and Highhold, the Clerics of Wegate, Clerics of Hastow, and Pirates of Saragossa. The deck of each ship is equipped with magical cannons, manned by Mortis Lux soldiers, the spelljammer helm, piloted by a magic caster, and multiple squads of living and undead Mortis Lux soldiers. The hull of the ships are specially designed to hold over 400 undead troops. The front of the ships can fully open to create a ramp, allowing the entire regiment of undead to march out of the ship.


## Magical Surfboards
Bazzdows creates magical spelljammer surfboards for the party. The higher the spell level used to power the surfboard, the faster they travel. Upon touching his board, Spoops saw a vision of himself using a 12th level spell to ride the board. In this vision, he went so fast that in an instant he collided with and shattered the cracked crystal sphere around Mardun, allowing the Emperor and his creature to invade. Luckily it was just a dream. However he does accidentally use a higher level spell slot and crash into the Great Port of Wegate, taking out some ships and docks. He deploys more undead labor to fix what he broke.
