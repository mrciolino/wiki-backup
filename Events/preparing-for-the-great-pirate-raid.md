# Preparing For The Great Pirate Raid
The party sails from [Hastow](/locations/Mardun/Hastow) to [Saragassa](/locations/Mardun/Saragassa). Upon arrival to Saragassa, they do some exploring before beginning preparations for the raid on [Allford](/locations/Mardun/Allford). 


## The Deck of Many Things
While on Saragassa, the party finds an ancient ruin with a teleportation circle while exploring the jungle. They believe it to be related to [Rathwing's](/characters/Rathwing) cult.

The party acquires the [Deck of Many Things](/items/Deck_Of_Many_Things) and begins drawing cards.

- [Spoops](/characters/spoops) pulls a card and acquires [Dio the map](/items/dio-the-map).
- Spoops pulls a card and is teleported away, becoming trapped in a crypt and is only freed when the party finds him.


## Krorg Begins His Plan
The party arrives at a tavern in Saragassa called The Whore's Nipple. At the tavern, [Krorg](/characters/krorg) begins spreading rumors that the [Pirate King](/characters/pirate-king) is going to make a major announcement tomorrow, which many pirates gain interest in. The next day, the Pirate King woke up and heard he was supposed to give a major annoucement but had no idea what was going on, and that is when Krorg approached him with the plan.


## Spoops Meets Vesrahaan
After a night of heavy drinking, Spoops ends up drunkenly preaching the good word of [Ry-ann](/characters/spoops) while wandering the alleys of Saragassa. He resurrects some random pirates he finds but they have no interest in hearing his sermon. He is approached by one person who wants to hear more, [Vesrahaan](/characters/vesrahaan). She is a Yuan-ti woman from [Wegate](/locations/Mardun/Wegate), who is a faithful worshipper of Ry-ann. They spend the next few hours talking about their shared religion and personal stories.


## Krorg's Plan is Put Into Action
The pirate king agrees to the plan to raid [Allford](/locations/Mardun/Allford) and assembles the pirate lords so that the strategizing may begin.

The party meets the [Bugbear captain](/characters/bugbear-captain), one of the pirate lords. The pirate fleet mobilizes, departing for Allford. Some of the party sail on the Bugbear captain's ship and others are on [Dave Bones'](/characters/Dave-Bones) ship.

Bazzert stays behind with a mission from Krorg to assassinate the Pirate King.
