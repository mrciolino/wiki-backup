# Return to Allford
The party returns to Allford to report back to Illiard about the cultists in Demsford.

## Reporting to Illiard at The Castle
Back in Allford, they go to see Illiard at his tower, but are informed by his secretary that Illiard is meeting with the king. Instesd of waiting for his return, the party steal a document with an Illiard seal on it, and bluff their way into the castle. The party are seated in a minor dinning room in the castle while they wait for Illiard to show up. 

During the 5 hours that they wait, Krorg and Spoops find a small girl playing under the stairs and play with her to pass the time. Illaird shows up and after the traumatic events of Demsford and the lack of information given by Illiard, the party doesn't trust Illiard and try to discern his true intentions. Spoops casts Zone of Truth and get him to say he just wants the Old Lich weapons/poisons so he can research them and be able to protect himself and Allford in case they are attacked by such things in the future. The team does have the green liquid vial, but they don't tell Illiard about it. Illiard also goves the party an urgent new mission, the king has a Beholder in his vault and Illiard asks the party to deal with it.


## Shopping
Then everyone goes shopping viciously haggling with local vendors. Krorg got a bad ass cape, Spoops got plate armor, Drakham spent a lot of money and agreed to an unscrupulous deal for a discount on armor, and Bazzert tries using every weird item he found as a crafting item to try and make a bunch of magic staffs even though he already has one and just doesn't use it/doesn't make an attempt to use it.
