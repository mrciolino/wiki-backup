# Adalynn Captured By Daurgothoth
Adalynn is saved form non-existence by Daurgothoth, only to be immediately enslaved by him.


## Adalynn is Enslaved
Daurgothoth uses some unknown method to extract Adalynn from the emptiness she was in after being struck by the Banhammer. 

Recognizing her powerful magical ability, he then binds Adalynn to his sevice by creating a magical collar using her own blood. Then he places it around her neck, binding it to her soul.


## Daurgothoth Gathers Gond Souls
Daurgothoth seems to have enslaved an entire community of gnomes and has also started to gather Gond souls fragments. He commands Adalynn to retrieve more Gond soul fragments. Forced to obey, she goes out to the nearby deep gnome settlement to gather Gonds.


## Adalynn Escapes

Adalynn uses some method to escale from Daurgothoth.

The few Gond soul fragments he gathered are destroyed in the process.
