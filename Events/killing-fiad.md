# Killing Fiad
The party departed with [Nut's](/characters/bane) caravan and while traveling across the plains of centaur tribes, they found an old enemy.


## Departing With Nut's Caravan
Before dealing with [King Sunfenix's](/characters/king-sunfenix) requests, the party traveled with Nut's carriage south from [Hellaress](/locations/Ereriad/Hellaress) along the coastline. 

During their journey, Nut sold [Spoops](/characters/spoops) the [Jack Sparrow's compass](/items/Jack-Sparrows-Compass). 


## The Centaur Tribes
Then they traveled along the plains where they ran into centaur tribes. The party defended the caravan from some hostile tribes as they passed through. While talking to some of the centaur's they came across a speaking stone that the centaurs claimed their god used to speak to them, the party heard a booming godlike voice coming through it, which they realized was fake. In response they used [Dio](/items/dio) to locate the source, went to the location and confronted the false god. 

## Fiad is Found and Killed
Upon discovering the false god was [Fiad](/characters/fiad) up to his old schemes, the party attacked. Fiad plead for mercy by explaining that he had worked under [Darmuth](/characters/Darmuth), but planned to betray her the whole time. He explained that he knew about her loyalities to [the Emperor](/characters/Emperor) and he believed he could get a better deal. He offered the party power and service under the Emperor, but the party declined his foolish offer and killed him.
