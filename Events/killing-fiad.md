Before dealing with King Sunfenix's requests, the party travels with Nut's carriage south from Hellaress along the coastline.  - During their journey, Nut sells Spoops the Jack Sparrow's compass. - Then they travel along the plains where they run into centaur tribes. The party defends the caravan from some hostile tribes as they pass through. While talking to some of the centaur's they come across a speaking stone that the centaurs claim their god speaks to them through, the party hears a booming godlike voice coming through it, which they realize is fake. In response they use Dio to locate the source, go to the location and confront the false god. Upon discovering the false god is Fiad up to his old schemes, the party attacks. Fiad pleads for mercy by explaining that he had worked under Darmuth but planned to betray her the whole time because he knew about her loyalities to the Emperor and he believed he could get a better deal. He offered the party power and service under the Emperor, but the party declined his foolish offer and killed him.
