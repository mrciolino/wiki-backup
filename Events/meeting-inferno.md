The party use Dio to travel to the location of the devastated landscape they saw after draeing a card from the deck of many things. Upon arrival, they come upon the ancient red dragon Inferno who was awoken from his centuries of slumber when the party drew the card. 


## Conversation With Inferno
The party tell Inferno of their travels and quest to defeat Darmuth. Inferno shares with the party his long held hatred of Darmuth. Through their shared hatred they form the start of a friendship. 

## Spoops is Granted a Scale
Inferno notices one of the swords Spoops carries is made of Dragon Bone and asks to see it. Spoops nervously complies while saying that he did not kill a dragon for the sword, he only found the bone. After examining it, Inferno told him that it matters not, as the bone belonged to some foolish whelp.

Before departing once again, Spoops asks Inferno if he could grant him one of his scales to forge into a sword thst he coulr use to fight Darmuth. Inferno agrees and gifts Spoops one of his red scales. This scale would later be forged into the sword Blazing Glory.
