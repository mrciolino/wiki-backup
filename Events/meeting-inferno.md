# Meeting Inferno
The party decide to revisit the giant red dragon they met on their way to Bahryst. The dragon happened to be living in the devastated landscape they previously saw after drawing a card from the deck of many things. 


## Inferno's Rest
The party use Dio to travel to the location of the devastated landscape they saw after draeing a card from the deck of many things. Upon arrival, they come upon the ancient red dragon Inferno who was awoken from his centuries of slumber when the party drew the card. 


## Conversation With Inferno
The party tell Inferno of their travels and quest to defeat Darmuth. Inferno shares with the party his long held hatred of Darmuth. Through their shared hatred they form the start of a friendship. 

After asking some questions, the party learned that Dartmouth had, at a point millennia ago, dated the dragon. Now, in a fit of rage and reminded of her scorn, the dragon seeks to destroy Dartmouth and flies toward the city of Altricia, Dartmouth's current base of operations. Before the dragon got there, the party recovered Bazzert's body by teleporting in and out of the Altricia castle vault so he would not be destroyed as well.

## Spoops is Granted a Scale
Inferno notices one of the swords Spoops carries is made of Dragon Bone and asks to see it. Spoops nervously complies while saying that he did not kill a dragon for the sword, he only found the bone. After examining it, Inferno told him that it matters not, as the bone belonged to some foolish whelp.

Before departing once again, Spoops asks Inferno if he could grant him one of his scales to forge into a sword that he could use to fight Darmuth. Inferno agrees so long as Spoops can manage to pry it off of his body. With great effort, Spoops is able to use Earth Terror to remove one of the scales. Impressed by this feat, Inferno gifts Spoops the scale. This scale would later be forged into the sword Blazing Glory.
