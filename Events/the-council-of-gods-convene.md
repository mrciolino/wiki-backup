# The Council of Gods Convene
The Council of Gods meets to discuss the Spoops problem. 

## The Emperor Captures Zeus 
Zeus travels to the Ithilid flagship to kill the Prophet of Profit. Weakened from his duel with Spoops, Zeus' mind is vulnerable to Illithid actions and they convert him into a dark god. The new Zeus turns into a floating head with tentacles, and can conjure physical memories as well as erase them permanently.


## Seeking Divine Aid
The party wants to find allies among the gods to help with the war, they begin reaching out to gods who have not been actively hostile in an attempt to make friends. Shar mysteriously does not answer their prayers. Next they try Mystra who is also silent until Adalynn prays to them and Mystra simply responds "No". Next they try the ever reliable Pyrocinae who shockingly also does not answer. Now the party is very concerned and contacts their recent ally Lolth. 

## The Major Gods Meet
Lolth does answer and in a hushed tone informs the party that the major Gods are locked in a council meeting to discuss "The Spoops Problem" she unfortunately cannot provide more detail as she is not allowed to attend the meeting due to her being a minor God owing allegiance to Shar. Pyrocinae eventually answers Bazzdos' prayer and quickly whispers that she cannot talk now as shes representing her father in the council meeting and theyre not supposed to speak to the party. The party grows increasingly concerned over this apparent "Council of Gods" which seem to be relentlessly pursuing Spoops with no interest in speaking.
