# Fort Suro Tavern Brawl
The beginning of Campaign one. Each of the original players received a mysterious invitation to gather at the tavern in Fort Suro for an adventuring opportunity. With so many big personalities gathered in one place, and confusion and suspicion around the invitation, it wasn't long before a brawl began.
