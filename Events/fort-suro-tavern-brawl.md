# Fort Suro Tavern Brawl
The beginning of Campaign one. Each of the original players received a mysterious invitation to gather at the tavern in Fort Suro for an adventuring opportunity. With so many big personalities gathered in one place, and confusion and suspicion around the invitation, it wasn't long before a brawl began.

## The Brawl
The party gathers in the tavern. All 12 of the original party, Spoops, Seriphi, Otto Hurtszog, Kiwi, Bazzert, Drakham, Os Vrntica, Frederina, Breezy-E, Stef, Krorg, and Pope, (Nick, Michelle, Carson, Dan, Matt, Spoon, Sean, Cat, Breezy, Stef, Peter, Pope) met in the tavern during (Session 0). They were all sent individual letters, inviting them to meet a mysterious caller at the tavern for a lucrative adventuring job. Upon arrival they all sat down together. With so many big personalities impatiently waiting, it wasn't long before the chaos began.

Stef stole from behind the bar and left the party. Then a fight broke out as Spoops began choking Os after the bard said some offensive things to him. Breezy E (a samurai) tried to cast a spell to call a tornado (not a spell and rolled a Nat 1) which would turn out to be one of the most magically significant events in history. This failed spell ended up summoning the demon Lokunai.

Drakham and Seriphi asked the demon if he was their father, they gained no evidence from him to indicate that he was the father of either of them, and so their search continues.

At this point Frederina ran to get the guards to break up the fighting between Spoops and Os, but the demon was now involved too. Once the guards arrived they were surprised to see a skeleton and began attacking. Spoops fought the guards alongside the Lokunai and proceeded to seduce the demon well. A romantic moment ensues, and Lokunai gives Spoops a weird stone with a glyph, alongside some vials of blood and hair. An odd gift but one Spoops appreciated greatly. 

Otto Hurtzog didn’t like Os’s bard antics, so he fired an arrow and knocked Os unconscious. He tried to play it off by lying and saying that Os had a bounty on him. At this moment Freedom the robot arrives to retrieve the party on behalf of Illiard the Wizard who sent the invitations. However as he arrives, Freedom sees Otto Hurtszog attacking Os and rushes to defend him. After ensuring Os' safety, Freedom goes to fight Lokunai. Lokinai is slain, however his body mysteriously disappears. It will be years before anyone realizes but in that moment, Lokunai did not perish, but instead possessed Freedom.

Bazzert got his ass kicked by the guards but was saved by freedom so that he may he live long and do something of importance.

Frederina lost a dagger and forgot to go back to get it at the pub.

With the tavern brawl finally at an end, the party rests. (Session 2 begins) Lokunai (now posessing Freedom's body) gives the party a quest to free his people, the warforged, from slavery. He points is in the direction of the Guard captain to find help then promptly departs. The captain asks the party to first help to clear the iron mines of goblins. The party goes from here to begin a life changing quest.

## Waking Up in The Barracks
The party woke up well rested in the basement of the Fort Suro guard barracks. However Drakham was chained up as the guards were convinced he had summoned the demon in Pope's Pub. The party went up to confont the captain of the guards about this, but then instantly tried to steal from him, and beg him for money and equipment. After getting $3.50 and three daggers, they pissed off the captain, received a quest from him to eliminate tur Goblin threat from the mines, and left shortly afterwards.
