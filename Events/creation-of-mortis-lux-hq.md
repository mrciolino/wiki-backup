# Creation of Mortis Lux HQ
[Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) uses her new spell to create the headquarters for [Mortis Lux](/organizations/mortis-lux) within its own custom demiplane.


## Raising The Mountain Castle
The party returns to the underwater elven city beneath the ocean on [Ereriad](/locations/Ereriad). [Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) casts her [Moving Mountains](/Spells/Moving-Mountains) 10th level spell to raise the city and some of the surrounding forest into the sky. The city itself was a massive city built atop a mountain. The city itself was surrounded by massive stone docks, except for the region behind the castle which consisted of a large wooded area. Then Adalynn uses a powerful 10th level spell of her own creation to carve out a demiplane of her own from the deep ethereal, using part of her soul to anchor the plane to multiple other worlds. She then inserts the mountain city into the demiplane, creating a secure private world to be used as Mortis Lux's HQ. 


## Shaping The Demiplane
By shaping the demiplane using her own soul as the anchor in combination with the soul of Dio the map and his planar power, Adalynn had complete control over the plane. She had power over the plane similar to the power a god has over their divine realm. She could permit and deny teleportation to the realm, and using Gate, could open portals of varying size to permit entry that way. 


## Securing The Realm
With the realm complete, the party got to work exploring the castle and exterminating any remaining unwanted creatures within the realm. The party cleared the castle and proceeded to the woodlands that were part of the flying island. Within this area they found plentiful wildlife and Adalynn even found a dragon's sanctuary: a sacred place for dragons to die.

Upon their return to the castle throne room, the party found an unwanted guest. The Witch King Bane. Realizing the castle was not fully secure, particularly against guests with divine power, the party devised a plan to have all wizards of Mortis Lux cast Private Sanctum all over the realm each day for a year to make it permanent. The only areas left unaffected by private sanctum were the ends of the docks and the throne room which would be heavily warded and guarded through various other means. Once completed this project was a massive success, with all intended areas being secured.


## Mortis Lux Members Arrive
With the Mortis Lux HQ completed, the party opened gates and brought the representatives, troops, and supplies of each member group to the new realm. Here they began getting their troops ready for the first major operation of Mortis Lux, The Githyanki War.
