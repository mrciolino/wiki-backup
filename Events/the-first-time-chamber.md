# The First Time Chamber
Spoops and Bazzdows use a wish to accelerate time to accomplish near impossible feats of forging, psychological torture, and programming.


## Entering The Time Chamber
Spoops uses a Wish to allow he and Bazzdows to spend 10000 years forging. During this time they combined Spoops' powerful magical swords into the Spoops Blade. 

Also Spoops subjugated Jormungandr by using the calming power of his Teddy Bear Heart to weaken their will, and many years of psycological torment to break their spirit. Spoops also spent time tinkering with Bazzdows' terminal, learning roboscript. 

After exiting what they dub "The Time Chamber", Spoops writes a script for Bazzdows that allows him to overclock his systems based on a perceived threat level.
