# Escape From Sigil
Spoops is captured by Marut and brought to Sigil to stand trial for reasons unknown to him at the time.

While awaiting trial in the courtroom gallery, he conspires to escape with a new friend named Elira.

## The Escape

Spoops awakes to find himself magically bound and sitting in the gallery of a courtroom among other similarly bound captives. Each of them about to stand trial before a panel of judges composed of Archangels of various gods. The panel is led by an Archangel of Bahamut. Spoops begins loudly demanding to know why he is there and yelling that he "wont be held by some kangaroo court". Bahamut's Archangel informs him that he is in the neutral ground of Sigil and he will have to wait his turn to have his chance to speak to his defense. 

Not one to wait around, Spoops begins talking to the prisoner seated next to him named Elira. Elira appears far more concerned at their predicament and she too is not keen on waiting around for judgement. Spoops tells her hes leabing and if she wanrs out to follow him. Spoops uses his anti-magic armor to break his magical restraints, then grabs Elira and jumps into his Well of Many Worlds. 


## Jumping Between Worlds
After entering the well, Spoops and Elira quickly traverse a few planets using the well before arriving in an incredibly large house seemingly built for a giant. They are quickly met by someone who looks exactly like Os except they are giant sized and emanating an evil aura. Spoops quickly executes this giant evil Os and seals their soul within his Diamond. Spoops and Elira then use the well to travel to Ereriad. Upon arrving in Ereriad they find themselves back with the rest of the party at the Magical College of Porthy. 


## Elira Joins The Party
After their prison break, Elira seems to be a bit distrustful of Spoops due to his erratic personality, however she decides to join up with the low bar brawlers and study magic alongside Adalynn until such time that they can return to their own plane to rescue their sister from an evil tyrant.
