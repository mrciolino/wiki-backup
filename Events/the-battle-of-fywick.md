# The Battle of Fywick
The party has been using Dio and their ship to track the movements of the giant bone devil that has been chasing them across the continent, as waves of lobster creatures begin attacking Fywick from the sea, fleeing the creature, the party realizes the real threat is close. They can see the monster on the horizon and so begin preparations for battle.

## Rip and Tear
The party rip and tear through legions of lobster creatures as they pour into the city. They work with the city guard to close the gates of the city and beat back the enemy. As Carl comes into view on the horizon, Os returns to the temple at the center of the city where the Oracle and Ralindu perform surgery on him to implant the shield generator.

## Shield Generator Surgery
Os is implanted with the Shield Generator, and Spoops takes down Darmuth's Bone Demon from the inside. As the rest of the party held off the assault, the lich Ralindu, Freedom, and the Oracle of Fywick performed the procedure to implant the shield generator device into Os' heart. Once the device was implanted, Os began his most brilliant performance yet, manifesting the Shield around the city, keeping the waves of monsters at bay while allowing the party and Fywick’s forces to clean up anything inside the barrier. 

## Slaying The Beast
Once Darmuth’s Creature reached the shield, Os managed to keep it at bay as the party attacked from the bow of their flying ship. They quickly realized that the bony carapace of the beast was too tough for them to pierce. Spoops had a crasy idea rhat might just work. He placed the Peace was never an option dagger in his mouth, and while holding two of his magical longswords and wearing the Shield Ring he leapt from the bow while saying "Peace was never an option" sending him spinning into the mouth of the monster, tearing it up from the inside, finishing the fight. 

## Spoops Gains A Knife Leg
Spoops came out the other side of the creature into the water in a mess of blood snd gore, the party pulled him out. Spoops was ok aside from his right leg which had been bitten off below the knee as he entered the mouth of the beast. Spoops replaced his missing leg using the Peace Was Never An Option knife he obtained earlier, attaching it to his bone with some of Narascus' soverign glue.
