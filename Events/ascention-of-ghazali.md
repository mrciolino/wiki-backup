# Ascention of Ghazali
After returning from the library, the party check in on the various happenings within Mortis Lux. Spoops remembers that Ghazali was ordered to acquire more gold and resources but has not returned. 


## Ghazali's Status
Spoops calls up Ghazali via speaking stone. Ghazali informs Spoops that he had been killed during The Prophet of Profit heist, and after being resurrected by Spoops, has been fighting guerilla warfare style against various dwarves and monsters in the forest below Sigil. Adalynn immediately gates Ghazali home.


## Ghazali's Ascention
Upon Ghazali's return, Spoops tells him that in recognition of both his recent failure, and past successes, he will be elevated to the position of his first Archangel. Spoops uses his divine powers to morph Ghazali's form into that of a skeletal winged angel. Spoops then names him Ghazali, The Archangel of Atonement. Spoops orders him to forge himself new armor and weapon fit for his position and form as an archangel. Spoops gives him the silver necklace of Ry-ann and an empty soul crystal to use in the creation of his armor. Bazzdos sends Ghazali into the forge dimension to begin.
