# Searching For Teddy
The party returns to Demsford after their investigation of the cultist fortress only to find everyone missing, including the child named Teddy they met when they first arrived.

## Everyone is Gone
The party returns to Demsford at night to find it abandoned with no signs of people or life. Then the party remembers the child they met before, Teddy, and begin to look for him. Alas, they can't find anyone in the town, so they head up to the cultist temple on the hill and find a lot of crucified corpses, half mutated and twitching, with disgusting bone appendages sticking out of them, but no sign of Teddy.

Everyone heads back to the inn and starts to pack up and leave as Spoops prays to his God Ry-ann for guidance who also said its time to leave. As the rest of the team prep the horse and carriage, Krorg goes back up to the temple to take one last look for Teddy. He finds the temple barred from the inside, but decides to just leave. The party leaves Demsford and heads back to Allford.
