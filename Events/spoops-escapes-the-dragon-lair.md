# Spoops Escapes The Dragon Lair
After being eaten by a dragon named [Karroash](/characters/karroash), [Spoops](/characters/spoops) is trapped by [Darmuth](/characters/Darmuth) in a [dragon lair](/locations/karroashs-lair) far to the south west ot [Gothriathon](/locations/Mardun/Gothriathon).


## Escaping The Lair
Spoops ends up trapped by Darmuth in what was formerly the dragon's hoard far to the south west of Gothriathon. He first investigates the piles of gold within the hoard, only to find they are just an illusion created by Darmuth. He uses his [knife leg](/items/peace-was-never-an-option-dagger) to fly up to the crystal barrier blocking his exit from the cavernous hoard, then he uses the [ring of misty step](/items/Ring-Of-Misty-Step) to pass through the barrier. Once he passed this first barrier, he found himself in a large cave filled with bones and corpses. Spoops barely noticed the poisonous fog in the air due to his immunity to poison. After he easily bypassed the defenses of the hoard, and returned to the surface, he used his knife leg to fly back to Gothriathon to meet up with the party. It took a few days of flying before the party used [Dio](/items/dio) to locate and intercept him.
