# Fighting Darmuth
The party arrive at [Darmuth's lair](/locations/Mardun/darmuths-lair), and upon discovering [Darmuth's](/characters/Darmuth) identity as an elder brain, they engage her in a battle for the fate of [Mardun](/locations/Mardun).


## Assault on Darmuth Begins
The party finds an illithid nest. They see pools filled with illithid tadpoles that attempt to infect the party. Many of the party narrowly avoid the tadpoles, the tadpoles attempting to inhabit [Spoops](/characters/spoops) find no brain to infect. However one does atttach to [Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) which the party has to remove later. At the center of the room is a massive elder brain, Darmuth's true form.

The party begin the battle for the fate of Mardun. They attack Darmuth with everything they have.

During the battle, [Bazzalt](/characters/Bazzalt) turns the party into adult copper dragons to assist in the fight.

Throughout the fight, the party has to desperately resist the psionic attacks from Darmuth while keeping up their attack.


## Os Travels Through Time
[Os](/characters/os) made a wish to be stronger. This caused him to suddenly disappear. Suddenly one of the stalagtites in the arena fell and shattered on the ground, reveling a coffin. Os was sent back in time over 1000 years to the ancient ash elf kingdom far to the north. Here he lived an entire lifetime where he became [King Tiyamani the Awesome](/characters/os). He got even stronger during this time, eventually being sealed and buried in a coffin beneath [Altricia](/locations/Mardun/Allford), directly at the site of the current battle. 


## Os Defeats Darmuth
Os emerged from the coffin, and rejoined the fight. Os immediately cast time stop and proceeded to forcibly teleport Darmuth above the volcano that was enlarged when [Aku's castle](/locations/Mardun/stronghold-of-fiery-ruin) was destroyed by dragon turtles from the sky. Os then cast her into the magma below. Darmuth was finally slain.


## A Tear Above Altricia
With her ritual to allow her master access to Mardun broken, the massive magical energies Darmuth wielded were released upon her death. The energy surged up and created a crack in the sky above Altricia. The party looked up and saw exactly how close Darmuth came to opening up the passage for her master "[The Emperor](/characters/Emperor)" to arrive on Mardun.


## Discovering Ereriad
[The Well of Many Worlds](/items/Well-Of-Many-Worlds) was found under Altricia. Os used mending to repair a small tear in the cloth of the well. As he laid out the mat and the tear was mended, the portal opened to another world. The party used the well to look into [Ereriad](/locations/Ereriad) where they saw immense Devastation Vermin attacking people. For the moment they close the portal to focus on recovering and rebuilding.


## Bazzalt Departs
Bazzalt left the party to live in the library dimension and spend time with his brother before [Bazvrah's](/characters/Bazvrah) consciousness completely merged into the tree of knowledge. 


## Luther Rebuilds Altricia
Luther stepped up to become regent of Altricia while the party, more concerned with the big picture, left.
