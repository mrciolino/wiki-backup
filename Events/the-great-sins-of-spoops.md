# The Great Sins of Spoops
In his desperation for power after being humiliated and slain, Spoops sought methods to quickly acquire power which led him to commit shameful sins.


## The first great sin of Spoops
After his fight with Zeus, Spoops traveled through the well of many worlds to Dolarion where he found a clan of goblins. He had the idea to recruit them as his worshippers in order to increase his own power as a god. However Bane showed up with an agenda of his own. Spoops and Bane conquer goblin clans of Dolarion while Bane leads Spoops around activating magic pillars. Bane promises this ritual will empower them both. 

7 second seige: While Spoops helps the goblins free themselves from oppressive gnoll clans. He converts various goblin villiages to his religon, then marches his army to the gates of their former goblin masters' fortress. In what is known as the 7 second seige, they conquer the fortress. Spoops installs a goblin named Boblin Gnollfriend as new leader of the clans.

The final pillar ends up shattering the planet, freeing the titan Iapetus. Iapetus gathers some of thr titanite metal which user to be his prison and forms i into a blade. Spoops is granted the Titanite Blade by Iapetus as thanks for freeing him.

## The second great sin of Spoops
Spoops asks Os to go to with him to the astral plane and Spoops uses the 12th level spell: Seed Life to spawn two planets worth of Owlbears which Os gathers into a bowl using his shield. Spoops casts Soul Absorption to harvest their power and distribute it among the party, granting them Epic Boons.
