# The Second Time Chamber
As they start preparing for war with the Githyankii, Spoops and Bazzdows come up with some plans and projects that require more time than they have. They realize that now is the perfect time to use Spoops' final wish to accelerate time once again to allow them to forge greatness!

## Entering The Time Chamber
During the preparations Spoops and Bazzdos go into the second time chamber. Creating the Shard of Divinity, and training Spoops' new divine powers.
A Second Time Chamber is enabled by Spoops casting his last remaining wish obtained earlier from the Deck of Many Things.
