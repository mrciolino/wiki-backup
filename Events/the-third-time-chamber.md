# The Third Time Chamber
Bazzdos and Spoops use the Earrings of Tiny Respite to create one last Time Chamber for some final preparations before the Ithilid War.


## Improving The Earrings
Bazzdos improves the Earrings of Tiny Respite, improving the time dilation to allow them to reopen after a few days rather than 7 years. 

## Entering The Time Chamber
After improving the earrings, Bazzdos and Spoops order some wights and todds to quickly bring crates of materials and supplies into the room. With everything they need inside, Bazzdos and Spoops enter the room and close the gate behind them. They spend the next 5000 years re-forging the Shard of Divinity into its perfect form, and crafting machines of immense power including the magically enhanced laser lenses, laser power sources, magical enhancement rings inscribed with runic spells, etc. 

One of the Todds ended up stuck in the room with them, so they spent some time teaching it to forge and attempted to teach him to speak.


## Equipping The Fleet
Upon leaving the Time Chamber, Spoops and Bazzdos have every ship equipped with a small laser beam. Tu'narath, Mecha-tarasque, HQ and the party's ship are equipped with large lasers. The Penne-trator missiles are also created to be piloted by the vanguard during the start of the final battle.
