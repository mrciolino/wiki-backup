# Reuniting in Gothriathon
After three years, [Krorg](/characters/krorg) is ready to go to war with [Gothriathon](/locations/Mardun/Gothriathon) over the economic situation. He wants [Os](/characters/os) captured and returned to [Altricia](/locations/Mardun/Allford) to be forced to open up Gothriathon to the dragon sea trading network.


## Bazzvrah Joins The Party
The brother of [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) began working under Krorg after Bazzert fell into a coma. [Bazvrah](/characters/Bazvrah) is an assassin who joins up with the party when sent by Krorg to capture Os.


## Os Vrntica's Gothriathon Faction
During the past three years, Os became the leader of a group affiliated with the southern provinces of Gothriathon. He has an army of dwarves. He holds significant public political power in Gothriathon and runs the nation from the background.

Ever since the siege of [Allford](/locations/Mardun/Allford), he has sworn allegiance to Krorg, now the Pirate King, as a cynical way of living life both safely and with financial security. Os has become obsessively pragmatic.

Then... He lost everything. Accused of betraying the group by Narascus, Os only survives because of [Spoops's](/characters/spoops) mercy.

In exile and confused, a dejected Os flees south with his cousin [Eugene](/characters/eugene-vrntica) and a select few other individuals discontented with the new rule in Allford.

Os lands in Gothriathon, where he had previously established himself as an ally and friend. He finds a home there, establishing himself as a community leader and force for justice. In the two and a half years between his exile of the northern kingdom and his establishment in the south, Os has built allies throughout the rural southern towns, starting with his old friend [Willy the Dwarf](/characters/willy-the-dwarf), expanding his good will throughout the isles.

Not all the towns around Gothriathon are peaceful, however. To establish a truce between the southern provinces, Os gathers his most trusted friends as a gang of enforces to maintain peace in the less organized areas. Though successful, Os and his gang draw too much attention, and with a bounty on his head, all the now-allied towns become targets of bounty hunters and rival gangs from other regions.

Os now finds himself the head of a para-military gang in charge of a ragtag group of southern towns. He and his allies struggle to be left in peace, simply wishing to live without constant interruption. He longs to talk to Krorg, his friend turned enemy, as he would undoubtedly be able to stop the aggression against him if he could only be convinced of Os’s innocence. After all, this was all a misunderstanding in the first place…

Krorg and his people were good to Os, and he truly does not know why he's been banished. He's honest about that and does not wish to cause conflict with Krorg.

Os earned the trust and respect of the south through actions and conflict resolution. At times he would be hunted, but he would prevail and show mercy, even helping those that wanted to hurt him, because he knew they had good reason to want the reward. They needed help, so Os gave it to them with the resources he got from his allies.


## Capturing Os
Krorg sends [Narascus](/characters/Narascus), [Frederina](/characters/Frederina), and [Bazvrah](/characters/Bazvrah) to Gothriathon to hunt down Os.

Spoops arrives at the docks in Gothriathon with some of his wights after fleeing [Wegate](/locations/Mardun/Wegate). He runs into his old party and Bazzvrah within the city. The party simply tells Spoops that they are on their way to see Os, not mentioning the plan to capture him.

After finding Os, Frederina is captured by Os' faction in gothriathon. 

This led to Os reuniting with Narascus, the party member responsible for his banishment. 

They trade her for Narascus who Os questions and tries to convince that he wishes for peace. Narascus doesnt believe him at first. Os sends Frederina back to Krorg with a message of peace.

The party (Frederina) acquires a flying ship while in Gothriathon from the [deck of many things](/items/Deck_Of_Many_Things). The ship is manned by skeletons with strange power symbols on their heads. This skeletal crew can be commanded by whoever is at the wheel steering the ship. Frederina departs on this ship when sent back to Krorg by Os.


## Meade Joins The Party
During his imprisonment, Narascus uses `Geas` to force Os' right hand man [Meade](/characters/meade) to serve him for the next 30 days. 

After joining the group, Meade does pull a card from the deck of many things and is granted a chicken.


## Os Comes Willingly
The party attack Os and his dwarven guards, trying to capture him. Spoops intervenes, trying to negotiate peace between the party and Os while fighting back Bazzvrah and saving Narascus from being beaten by Os and the dwarves. Os, Meade, and Narascus come to terms. Os surrenders, asking that he he brought back to Altricia to answer for his crimes against capitalism and to negotiate peace. The party fully reunites and sails back to Altricia.

While Os and Narascus clashed initially, their meeting allowed Os to finally confront Narascus, who recognized his mistake(and had an existential crisis along the way). During the journey home, Os was accepted back into the party, exonerated and forgiven.
