# Reuniting in Gothriathon
After three years, Krorg is ready to go to war with Gothriathon over the economic situation. He wants Os captured and returned to Altricia to be forced to open up Gothriathon to the dragon sea trading network.


## Bazzvrah Joins The Party
The brother of Bazzert began working under Krorg after Bazzert fell into a coma. Bazzvrah is an assassin who joins up with the party when sent by Krorg to capture Os.


## Os Vrntica's Gothriathon Faction
During the past three years, Os became the leader of a group affiliated with the southern provinces of Gothriathon. He has an army of dwarves. He holds significant public political power in Gothriathon and runs the nation from the background.

## Capturing Os
Krorg sends Narascus, Frederina, and Bazvrah to Gothriathon to hunt down Os.

Spoops arrives at the docks in Gothriathon with some of his wights after fleeing Wegate. He runs into his old party and Bazzvrah within the city. The party simply tells Spoops thst they are on their way to see Os, not mentioning the plan to capture him.

Dave Bones returns to life again.

After finding Os, Frederina is captured by Os' faction in gothriathon. They trade her for Narascus who Os questions and tries to convince that he wishes for peace. Narascus doesnt believe him. Os sends Frederina back to Krorg with a message of peace. 

The party (Frederina) acquires a flying ship while in Gothriathon from the deck of many things. The ship is manned by skeletons with strange power symbols on their heads. This skeletal crew can be commanded by whoever is at the wheel steering the ship. Frederina departs on this ship when sent back to Krorg by Os.


## Meade Joins The Party
During his imprisonment, Narascus uses `Geas` to force Os' right hand man Meade to serve him for the next 30 days. 

After joining the group, Meade does pull a card from the deck of many things and is granted a chicken.


## Os Comes Willingly
The party attack Os and his dwarven guards, trying to capture him. Spoops intervenes, trying to negotiate peace between the party and Os while fighting back Bazzvrah and saving Narascus from being beaten by Os and the dwarves. Os, Meade, and Narascus come to terms. Os surrenders, asking that he he brought back to Altricia to answer for his crimes against capitalism and to negotiate peace. The party fully reunites and sails back to Altricia.
