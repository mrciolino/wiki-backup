# Gathering Materials For The Imprisonment Spell
Spoops realizes that before the war, he should ensure the party has the materials they need to reinforce the imprisonment of Kronos.


## Spoops Gathers Materials For Imprisoning Kronos
Spoops uses the pen of Jergal to ensure the party have everything they need to reinforce the imprisonment of Kronos once the war is over. He writes the following:
"The following list of materials will be acquired from worlds throughout the multiverse, the planes, the heavens and the hells, so that no single world is affected more than any other, and so that no inhabitants of any of these worlds are found wanting of these listed materials. rare soporific herbs, and every kind of metal and gem. The amount of each material is to be the amount required for each condition of the spell imprisonment to be cast on cronos the titan three times. all these materials are to be safely deposited within the vault of wegate, the demiplanes that adalynn keeps her treasure, and in the dungeons of adalynn's island fortress."

The materials are successfully gathered within the designated locations.
