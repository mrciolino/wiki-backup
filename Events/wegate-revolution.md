# Wegate Revolution
During the three year timeskip after the death of Krorg, Spoops and his loyal follower Vesrahaan traveled from Altricia to Wegate to re-establish the nation as a theocracy led by the Cult of Ry-ann. 

## The cult of Ry-ann
Spoops and Vesrahaan arrived in Wegate and made contact with Vesrahaan's trusted companion Nemotih who had been overseeing the Cult of Ry-ann's activities while Vesrahaan was away. His divine nature still forgotten to him, Spoops was lnown as the Prophet of Ry-ann. The three of them began to preach throughout the city, gathering followers while narrowly avoiding capture by the guards who was still loyal to the current government. 

After years of work bolstering their forces, the cult of Ry-ann was resey to tske the city. Led by Spoops the Prophet, they planned to storm the castle and take out the government directly, however they were betrayed by Nemotih. In exchange for his old position as a general back, he had betrayed the cult, leading the loyalists to their meeting places in local taverns slaughtering hundreds of cultists. Vesrahaan and the surviving cultists went underground while Spoops was forced to flee the city, returning to the party as a failure he accomplished next to nothing over these three years. Spoops swore to Vesrahaan that he would soon return with the Low Bar Brawlers and the cult would retake the city.
