# The First Great Sin of Spoops
In his desperation for power after being humiliated by [Vlaakith](/characters/vlaakith), [Spoops](/characters/spoops) sought a method to quickly acquire power which led him to commit his first shameful great sin.


## Releasing the Titan Iapetus
After being shamed by Vlaakith for failing to raise [Tu'narath](/locations/tunarath), Spoops traveled through the [well of many worlds](/items/Well-Of-Many-Worlds) to [Dolarion](/locations/dolarion) where he found a clan of goblins. He had the idea to recruit them as his worshippers in order to increase his own power as a god. However [Bane](/characters/bane) showed up with an agenda of his own. Spoops and Bane conquer the goblin clans of Dolarion while Bane leads Spoops around activating magic pillars. Bane promises this ritual will empower them both. 

7 second seige: While Spoops helps the goblins free themselves from oppressive gnoll clans. He converts various goblin villages to his religon, then marches his army to the gates of their former goblin masters' fortress. In what is known as the 7 second seige, they conquer the fortress. Spoops installs a goblin named [Boblin Gnollfriend](/characters/boblin-gnollfriend) as new leader of the clans.

The final pillar ends up shattering the planet, freeing the titan [Iapetus](/characters/iapetus). Iapetus gathers some of the titanite metal which used to be his prison and forms it into a blade. Spoops is granted the [Titanite Blade](/items/Titanite-Blade) by Iapetus as thanks for freeing him.
