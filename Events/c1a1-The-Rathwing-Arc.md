Fort Suro Tavern Brawl

The beginning of the first campaign. Each of the original players received a mysterious invitation to gather at a tavern in Fort Suro for an adventuring opportunity. With so many big personalities gathered in one place, and confusion and suspicion around the invitation, it wasn't long before a brawl began.
The Brawl

The party gathers in the tavern. All 12 of the original party, Spoops, Seriphi, Otto Hurtszog, Kiwi, Bazzert, Drakham, Os Vrntica, Frederina, Breezy-E, Stef, Krorg (then known as Morgan Gilthur), and Pope, (Nick, Michelle, Carson, Dan, Matt, Spoon, Sean, Cat, Breezy, Stef, Peter, Pope) met in the tavern during (Session 0). They were all sent individual letters, inviting them to meet a mysterious caller at the tavern for a lucrative adventuring job. Upon arrival they all sat down together. With so many big personalities impatiently waiting, it wasn't long before the chaos began.

Stef stole from behind the bar and left the party. Then a fight broke out as Spoops began choking Os after the bard said some offensive things to him. Breezy E (a samurai) tried to cast a spell to call a tornado (not a spell and rolled a Nat 1) which would turn out to be one of the most magically significant events in history. This failed spell ended up summoning the demon Lokunai.

Drakham and Seriphi asked the demon if he was their father, they gained no evidence from him to indicate that he was the father of either of them, and so their search continues.

At this point Frederina ran to get the guards to break up the fighting between Spoops and Os, but the demon was now involved too. Once the guards arrived they were surprised to see a skeleton and began attacking. Spoops fought the guards alongside the Lokunai and proceeded to seduce the demon well. A romantic moment ensues, and Lokunai gives Spoops a weird stone with a glyph, alongside some vials of blood and hair. An odd gift but one Spoops appreciated greatly.

Otto Hertzog didn’t like Os’s bard antics, so he fired an arrow and knocked Os unconscious. He tried to play it off by lying and saying that Os had a bounty on him. Gilthur also pulls out an invisible gun to shoot Os, though it is unclear where he got such a powerful magical item from. At this moment Freedom the robot arrives to retrieve the party on behalf of Illiard the Wizard who sent the invitations. However as he arrives, Freedom sees Otto Hurtszog attacking Os and rushes to defend him. After ensuring Os' safety, Freedom goes to fight Lokunai. Lokinai is slain, however his body mysteriously disappears. Nobody realized but in that moment, Lokunai did not perish, but instead possessed Freedom's robot body.

Bazzert got his ass kicked by the guards but was saved by freedom so that he may he live long and do something of importance.

Frederina lost a dagger and forgot to go back to get it at the pub.

With the tavern brawl finally at an end, the party rests. (Session 2 begins) Lokunai (now posessing Freedom's body) gives the party a quest to free his people, the warforged, from slavery. He points is in the direction of the Guard captain to find help then promptly departs. The captain asks the party to first help to clear the iron mines of goblins. The party goes from here to begin a life changing quest.
Waking Up in The Barracks

The party woke up well rested in the basement of the Fort Suro guard barracks. However Drakham was chained up as the guards were convinced he had summoned the demon in Pope's Pub. The party went up to confont the captain of the guards about this, but then instantly tried to steal from him, and beg him for money and equipment. After getting $3.50 and three daggers, they pissed off the captain, received a quest from him to eliminate tur Goblin threat from the mines, and left shortly afterwards.

 Fort Suro Goblin Mine

The first real quest the party receives after their brawl at the tavern. The party is tasked by the Captain of the Fort Suro Guard, Guardison, to eliminate the goblin menace that has taken over the fort's iron mine. The party accepts and gets to work.
The Quest

Prior to beginning the quest, Spoops stops at a local church on the way to the mine. His memory still hazy after washing ashore, he knows he is a paladin, but needs to remember what god he served and receive their blessing. Unfortunately he didn’t get the blessing he was looking for from the priests instead he was turned away due to being a skeleton.

The quest began as the party went into the iron mine. They fought the goblins within, and found Bomb the Bear.

Krorg suplexes Bomb the Bear into a chest and carries him out of the mine. As the party is on their way out of the mine, the goblin captain comes back with a badger and rolls a cannon out and fires it at the party, but they are still in the cave and able to dodge out of the way. Os died after being shot by multiple arrows and getting hit by a minecart. However like the fucking gambler he is, Drakham used his tides of chaos to get himself back up from death and fucked with the winds of magic and reincarnated Os Vrntica back into a high elf.

The party stuffs the goblin captain into the cannon and takes him alive to bring him back to the town guard captain. The guard captain thanks the party and says there is a merchant transport going to a fishing village towards the major city of Kaltrosar, so the party join them on the journey.
The Ghostly Pickle

After defeating the goblins and their spoils looted, the party collects their rewards from Captain Guardison in the Fort Suro barracks. After being a bit disatisfied with their reward, the party narrowly decides against violence. Seeking work, the party join a caravan as an escort which leaves for Trelston on the way to Kaltrosar in the morning. The party sleeps in Popes Pub for free, and Otto is disturbed out of his sleep by a ghostly pickle named Pickle Rick. After waking a couple other people, the party talk with the ghostly pickle and it gives them a clue to Spoops' forgotten past, and that the truth of the matter lies with Guardison Sr. in Trelston.

 Entertaining Bandits

The party runs into bandits on their way to Trelston.
Traveling With The Caravan

After speaking with a ghostly pickle named Pickle Rick in Fort Suro, the party departs in the morning with the caravan. However, they run into highwaymen who demand a toll, but instead of fighting them, the party try to pay the toll by entertaining the bandit leader named Balk and his crew of ne'er-do-wells. Not only do they succeed, but Otto and Drakham steal 250 Gold and 5 Grenades, and Balk enjoys the performance so much that he gives a standing ovation and allows the party and caravan to go unmolested.

 Arrival in Trelston

The party arrives in the small fishing village of Trelston. They get involved in some situations with a guardison, a horrible creature, and badgers. Upon arrival the caravan pays the party for their protection.
The Party Take Care of Individual Things

While in the village, the party have very different ideas on what to do next.

Frederina, Os, and Drakham hang around the docks. Suddenly Frederina's patron, a giant faceless tentacled golden lobster, appears to Frederina. A void portal opens, and Os and Drakham join Frederina in jumping into the void, encountering lots of teeth and evil patron vibes. Federina accepts servitude to her patron. Os and Drakham agree to help her out as well.

Bazzert almost started a fight with the locals over them not having a magic staff for him to buy

Drakham's wild magic was still Eff'd so he was just casting random spell effects and clutching things.

Krorg managed to tame and befriend the Bear in the box. After befriending him, Krorg renames him Bomb the Bear.
Guardison Senior

The party went to the tavern in town called "The Wispy Rat". Guardison the guard talked about.

Bazzert, Drakham, and Frederina happens upon very hostile badgers near town, they escape their assault and and get to the lighthouse where they happen to meet Guardison Sr.. They lead him back to town to meet Spoops and the rest of the party.

But right before Guardison can meet the team Drakham's uncontrollable powers of the magic weave have acted strangely and now his magic is cursed.

The party makes it to town where Guardison gets absolutely freaked out by Spoops who then chased him around. Eventually he introduces himself as Guardison Sr. and tells Spoops what he knows.

Guardison Sr. tells Spoops that there was a Paladin who was grand master of the Knights of Sedonnya named Spoops during the Lich Wars who departed on a ship from Trelston but was betrayed by his own crew and drowned at sea.

Spoops then tried to kidnap and rob Guardison Senior outside the lighthouse to obtain his magic Wind Amulet. Guardison was able to mostly evade Spoops when he used the power of the wind amet to bypass the powerful gale force winds blocking the path to the lighthouse. However Spoops eventually prevails and gets the amulet from him.
Badger Badger Badger

The Wind Amulet needs to be recovered so Gaurdison can man the lighthouse, but Spoops really wants it. The party goes to get it from him. Drakham gets it first and places it in a lockbox at the nature shrine in the woods outside of town. Spoops breaks into the lockbox, angering the spirit who summons badgers. In response, Frederina sets the forest on fire.

This action caused a swarm of badgers to appear and attack the group. As they attacked, the badgers chanted "Badger Badger Badger".

During the fight, Frederina set the forest ablaze and after 20 minutes kiwi took it upon himself to get people to help the guards put out the fire.

After causing absolute chaos and harassing the villagers, the party leaves town and heads to Kaltrosar Bay looking for work.

 Chaos in Kaltrosar

The party arrives in Kaltrosar Bay looking for work. However, with no clear quest, their visit deteriorates into chaos.
Disguising Bomb

Prior to arriving in Kaltrosar, Krorg dressed up Bomb the bear to disguise him so he could get him in to human places.

The group arrives at Kaltrosar Bay, gets paid for eliminating some bandits on their way, and looks for more work. First they go to the castle looking for work, but that doesn't work out because Krorg brought a bear which gets them kicked out.

Then they head to the merchant's guild where they get a job to clear out the sewers of Kaltrosar bay.

While this was happening, Bazzert had transformed into a squirrel and infiltrated the castle himself. However Bazzert screws up his disguise as a squirrel and is led to the dungeon.
Frederina Gets Arrested

Drakham and Krorg later get inside the castle with Otto, and Frederina. However Frederina gets arrested for touching the soft hands of the prince of kaltrosar.
An Attempt Was Made to Actually Do The Sewer Quest

Krorg, Drakham, and Otto get a lieutenant of the guards to lead them to the sewer access in the castle's dungeon where they meet up with the imprisoned Bazzert and Frederina.

With half the party imprisoned, Drakham tries valiantly to unfuck the situation by attempting to persuade the guards that they are here to check the security of the castle, and they failed this inspection by letting the party in, the guards don't buy this lie.
Things Escalate

The group gives in and is arrested but then Drakham accidently kills lord Barrymoore in one hit. Then more guards arrive directly from the king of Kaltrosar. Bazzert angers the guards so they try to kill him.

After fighting through a large meaty man, the group frees themselves from the dungeon and Freedom gets their stuff back.
The City Burns

Then Freedom sets fire to the castle, and as the group escapes they gather Os, Seiriphi, Spoops, and Kiwi.

The group escapes by distracting dock workers with free beer while freeedom set fire to the dock before they everyone stowed away in cargo crates on a ship owned by the Robin Trading Company who was leaving Kaltrosar Bay.

 Attacked by Pirates

The party is attacked by pirates while escaping Kaltrosar Bay aboard the Robin Trading Company's ship.
Negotiating Travel

The party, other than Freedom, wake up on a trading ship owned by the Robin Trading Company.

After leaving their barrels and being caught, they start a bidding war with the captain for the price of the voyage on his ship. As that devolves into chaos, the party tries to kill him when suddenly the ship is attacked by Orcish pirates.
Pirates Attack

The party and sailors all team up to fight the pirates. Os Vrntica woke up Freedom who came up and finished off the pirates on their ship.
Krorg vs. Freedom

As the ship's crew fights off the pirate ship, Krorg fights Freedom with bomb the bear and a Cannon.

All of pirates on the ship are now dead and the fighting is over. After witnessing (and accidentally causing) Freedom's genocidal behavior in Kaltrosar Bay, fearing Freedom would attract the attention of vengeful armies, and being a general Luddite, Krorg decides to use the opportunity to eliminate Freedom.

Os and Drakham both try to stop the fighting, but Krorg is set in his belief that Freedom is a dangerous weapon that the Low Bar Brawlers have only begun to abuse. Os issues an order to Freedom not to kill anyone in the party and to destroy the remaining pirate ships. Seconds later, Krorg starts blasting.

The first shot knocks Freedom deep into the ship, before Drakham casts reduce on the size of the cannon. Hearing Freedom moving below, Krorg and Bomb decide to gain the high ground in the fight by climbing the ship's mast. Drakham successfully charms Krorg to climb back down to the deck. Krorg agrees to surrender, but his sudden change in nature causes him to be bitten by Bomb, ending the spell.
A Dragon Turtle Arrives

Off the side of the ship, a Dragon Turtle appears and attacks the ships. Freedom jumps aboard the Dragon Turtle and begins riding it, and drives it into the remaining pirate ships, destroying them. Krorg thanks Bomb for saving him, and decides to leave Bomb behind to the safety of the Low Bar Brawlers. Then Krorg runs and dives off of the mast into the water, catching the dragon turtle's tail before being dragged off into the horizon...

The rest of the gang now heads off to Allford with the Captain and his ship.

Tracking The Thief to The Sewers

After the robbery, Kiwi found and read some thieves cant, and saw the thief head to the park and down into a sewer tunnel entrance.

Then Bazzert almost set the park on fire as he produced flames while inside a bush. The party put out the fire by urinating on a bear rug and throwing it upon the burning bush.

Drakham is first to find the thief so he sneaks up on them and scares them. They pickpocket the corrupt guards in the thief tunnel and get the guards to point them in the direction the thief ran.

Spoops had been exploring Allford before jouning up with the party, and he noticed that his presence seemed to piss off everyone in town. He learns that undead are hated because of a decades long conflict that ended 25 years ago called the Necrotic Wars, and that to this day people still hate the undead.

The party then went down in the sewer, getting covered in excrement. Bazzert almost killed himself and Drakham using another fire spell while in a cloud of methane above a pool of poop.
Secret Dungeon in The Sewer

After everyone got covered in crap they found a small entrance with a staircase leading further down. They found themselves in a tight corridor, then fighting spiders and zombies in trap filled hallways.

Drakham and Bazzert are cornered by a pack of spiders and Drakham justs annihilates them with his magical abilities.

Then the party finds the lost halfing pickpocket and drag him along through hallways of trap filled, skeleton filled danger.

Os Vrntica follows up this excitement with a calming ballad which reinvigorate the party and prepares them for the rest of the dungeon, the likes of which are filled with a gelatinous cube, more spiders, and a Wall of Fire.

The gang finds a mysterious wall of fire and weird paintings that light up with proper activation, but before figuring out the mystery they have to deal with a mimic.

And then BOOM! out of nowhere Krorg re-enters the fray and with a pirate crew with one goal to kill Freedom.

After some introductions and re-introductions Krorg's crew dispel the wall of fire and are ready to move on to the dungeon exit.

Behind the wall of fire, Spoops obtains an immovable rod and mirror shield.

 Arrival to Illiard's Tower

Krorg and his pirates lead the infiltration of Illiard's tower with the goal of killing Freedom.
Krorg's Crew

This pirate crew came together after the pirate boarding at sea gone wrong on the way to Allford. As Krorg ended up marooned on the shore of Saragassa with the pirate Nathar. He was still looking to kill Freedom. They met with the Pirate King and added Dave Bones, Darfallen, and Xialethia to the Freedom kill team. They followed Freedom accross the sea to Allford and found clues pointing to Illiard's Tower. They burst into the city sewers to enter the tower at its weakest point to avoid the defenses Freedom would have put up. Little did they know, the defenses they were avoiding didn't exist and they were heading for a trap. Luckily they ran into the rest of the party who happened to be in the same sewer system. After reuniting Krorg had his new crew dispel the firewall stopping the party from proceeding.
Entering The Tower

Then the group moved forward and searched the next room only to find gibbets filled with corpses.

Spoops checks out the nearby bedroom while Bazzert goes back to search some unexplored rooms and finds more cob webs and spider egg clutches, but leaves as he hears ominous scuttling noises. Soon after, the pickpocket that was confonted in the sewers was torn to shreds by some unknown creature. The party left him to his fate.
Encountering a Necrotic Wizard

After some searching, Spoops and Bazzert find a book and unlock the ability to unlock and lock a certain door. Krorg blocks the path behind the party while Spoops opens up a door to see a woman surrounded by four skeletal ogres. The woman unleashes the ogres and a storm of fireballs at the party. However, with some luck and perseverance, the party weathers the storm and defeats the evil necrotic wizard.
Confronting Illiard

The party then navigates some very dangerous fireball traps and another pool of shit, only to find themselves at the bottom of deep 35 ft. pit with random trash being dropped down on them.

After confronting the one dropping the trash, they find out they are Lucidel Illiard (Remember him kids he'll be important) owner of Illiard Tower and and a Merchant Lord of Allford.

After helping the party out of the hole, he introduces himself and tells them that Freedom is in the other room.
Freedom's (Lokunai) Soul is Sealed

Freedom arrives after being called, seeming to be beat up and a bit waterlogged. Upon arriving, he is confronted by Dave Bones, Krorg and the other pirates. Dave pulls out an ancient magic jar, The Hendrica Capsule, and sucks the soul out of Freedom. Everyone looks on as red ominous demonic tendrils lash from the robotic frame to the insides of the jar and are sealed by Dave Bones. Freedom's body goes limp and falls to the floor.

With their business done the pirates start to leave, but Nathar confronts the others saying he is there to kill Freedom for destroying his ships at sea. Dave Bones replies with "If ya here for death then I'll give it to ya!" and Shanks Nathar in the neck and Nathar falls, instantly bleeding to death.
An Insane Intro To Illiard and Beginning of the Quest

After such an unexpected and grizzly scene, Bazzert asks Illiard if he can read him a book, and Spoops asks for help trying to get a giant spider to hatch from a spider egg so it can be his pet.

The utter psychotic levels of emotional awareness being shown forced Illiard to notice the glow from Spoops pants (No this is not getting sexual). Illiard asks Spoops if he has any magic items in his pocket. Spoops reveals the demonic stone that he received from his demon boytoy Lokunai from the Fort Suro bar. Illiard then reveals the stones true nature, a soul prison, and he releases the soul within it which flows back into Freedoms body. This causes freedom's empty body to rise back to life.

Illiard explains that when Spoops killed the demon as it lay covered in booze, bleeding and dying, he actually had helped finish a demon ritual that trapped Freedom's soul in the stone that Spoops had been holding and it put the Demon's soul into Freedom's body.

Now with Freedom restored, the truth revealed, and the party having met Illiard, he asks them if they've been to Fort Suro. They respond yes, and Illiard says that he has a job for them.

 Traveling to Demsford

The party departs to make their way to Demsford to investigate cult activity.
Underwater Cavern

Bazzert and Krorg meet with Bazzert's master Ayod in an underwater cave. Ayod has come to tell his estranged student Bazzert that some stars are disappearing from the sky and he doesn't know why. Then Ayod helps train Bazzert to read the weird book.

Krorg resurfaces to see Frederina talking to the golden lobster. Upon closer inspection, he realizes she is entranced by it and doesn't notice Krorg. Os Vrntica and Krorg try to lift the lobster, treating this almost like a competition, but they both fail completely to lift said golden lobster. After all that and having their horses be inconveniently dead, Bomb and Bazzert (transformed into a bear) pull the carriage to Demsford.
Spoops Makes Haste to Demsford

Four days prior to the rest of the party's arrival in Demsford, Spoops is still in Allford strolling out of a bar when suddenly he hears the voice of the lord, his mysterious God. Spoops' god says "Get your shit together and ride north". Spoops then robs a man passing by of his horse and leaves him on the street. He then rides north out of Allford. He rides for 4 days and gets to Demsford first and then immediately goes to the bar and drink.

 Fighting Cultists in Demsford

The party arrives in Demsford and tracks down the cultists.
Rallying The Mob

On their way into the village, the party are greeted by desicated corpses strung up on crosses, these were some of the villagers. The party then immediately sees an orphan boy and talk to him his name is Teddy and his parents were killed by the cult. Our heroes then go to the bar and meet up with Spoops. They rally the villagers into a mob to kick the cult out of town. with the party at the head of the mob, every cultist they find is cut down except for one as he will be used to lead the team to the cultist fortress.
The Cultist's Fortress

After a couple of hours trekking through the woods, the party arrive just outside the fortress, and run into a cultist patrol. One of the patroling cultists run into view and then is turned into a pile of goo by Bazzert's acid arrow. Bazzert would repeat this trick on their guide cultist to get rid of loose ends. However loose ends were no longer the focus as there was an entire fortress of cultists to fight.

Krorg and bomb mount the battlements and start slaughtering the cultists, Os and Spoops charge the front gate while on horseback taking out a couple of enemies, but sustaining major damage. Bazzert and Drakham do a few things like arguing and turning into gas, but besides that not a whole lot. The battle quickly takes a turn for the worse as every cultist comes over to fight the would be defilers (the party), Krorg and Bomb get pinned down by a crossbow and magic barrage while the rest of the team is following behind.
The Drakham Plan

Drakham proposes his first plan whoch is to retreat and wait until the cultists aren't alert and then break in by making holes in their wall and kill them all group by group instead of a frontal assault against all of them at once.

However the cult fortress already has holes in its walls and Krorg and Bomb would eventually die if left alone to fight all the cultists by themselves.
The Second Drakham Plan

Drakham proposes a second plan to ride around the side of the fortress and flank the cultists on horseback like a mini cavalry charge and saving Krorg and Bomb.

This plan while a bit better also failed as one of the cultist ran to get his boss. During the time before the cultist boss shows up Bazzert is attack by the fortress firing squad and gets struck by crossbow bolts and fire bolts and falls unconscious in a burning tree, good thing Frederina stopped the flames from burning Bazzert alive and pulling him from the tree.
Veerian Rathwing Arrives

Bazzert is now pulling a lot of weight and starts obliterating the cultists with lightning and moonbeams, thinning out the firing squad targeting Krorg and Bomb.

However Krorg and Bomb have bigger issues now as Veerian Rathwing arrives and animates 5 gold coins from his pocket and sends them to attack Bomb. The coins brutalize Bomb and Bomb falls unconscious after a tiring fight being pin-cushioned by cultist crossbows, burned by firebolts and now he succumbs to the coins. Everyone now focuses on Rathwing as the cultists are all dead except for two, and those who decided to run rather than die.

In the ensuing battle Krorg throws his trident into the side of Rathwing and then pulls Rathwing from the air down over the fortress walls. The rest of the team closes in for the kill but Rathwing goes invisible and attacks the team from the shadows. A fireball strikes Spoops and Drakham causing Drakham to fall but Spoops gives chase toward the direction of the attack. Rathwing fails to blind Spoops and he casts detect good and evil now seeing Rathwing's evil aura.
Bomb The Bear Dies

Not knowing Bomb was just slain, Krorg runs to aid Drakham, breaking two of the five animated gold coins on his way as Drakham is dying on the ground. Spoops continues to battle an invisible Rathwing and Bazzert attacks Rathwing with his Moonbeam but also Scorching Spoops with the holy moonfire which causes Spoops to fall unconcious. Krorg helps Drakham who pulls out some wild magic and absorbs the life force of the animated coins, and some of Krorgs, and rises from near death like a phoenix. Quickly after this Rathwing disengages from the fight and says "You are all vermin who aren't worth my time and these peasants are useless, I've already got what I wanted. Au revoir" Rathwing disappears and moments later Krorg sees him flying away westward over the hills and trees.

Krorg now goes back to where Bomb was lying on the ground and discovers that bomb is dead. He and Drakham are greatly saddened by this loss and move him to the riverside to bury him. Meanwhile Bazzert decides to try and decipher his book and is able to just read the first line in the the book... "How to kill Gods"
The Burial of Bomb

Drakham and Spoops are arguing over what to do with Bomb as Krorg sleeps. Drakham wants to bury Bomb and Spoops in desperation, demands they keep the corpse until they find a way to Bring him back to life. Being undead himself, yet unable to save his friend Bomb from death devastates Spoops. They enter into a mexican standoff, Drakham clutching his last grenade and Spoops with rope threatening to take Bomb's corpse. Eventually Krorg wakes up and decides to bury Bomb, Drakham Charms Spoops and forces him to go along with this plan. Drakham used a patch from his cloak to excavate a 10 by 10 by 10ft hole to bury bomb and after some kind words the group bury bomb with the cultists. But there were too many cultists for the hole and so the party burned the corpses and then finished the burial.

Spoops desperately prayed to whoever this mysterious God of his was, begging for guidance and swearing he would never let a tragedy like this happen again. His god answered hos prayer, granting him the powers of his Oath.

 Investigating The Cultist's Fortress

After burying Bomb and burning the bodies, the party returns to their mission and investigates the fortress.
Bazzert Gathers Things Suspiciously

After the funeral, the party return back to the mission at hand to search for artifacts and weapons belonging to the old Liches of the necrotic wars. Along they way Bazzert finds a cool looking gem and gathers a bunch of random ingredients that aren't that suspicious for a druid to gather but he did so in a suspicious manner.
Vials of Green Liquid

The party find excavated areas in the fortress and among them, a chest contaminated with a green glowing liquid. They find all the vials within are broken except one half filled vial.

Drakham and Spoops then conduct some "experiments" on the liquid, combining it with holy water, spit, seeing if it flammable, and taking contaminated dirt and dumping it into a freshly made grave. the green liquid sizzles away from the holy water, just combines with the spit, is very flammable, and does not show any immediate effect on the grave.
Investigsting The Tower

The team search a tower on the east side of the ruined fortress and find a pentagram symbol and a flayed body stabbed with a demonic dagger. Spoops decides to be cautious and throw a dagger into the body in the pentagram. Then Krorg takes the arcane focuses he got from the cultist wizards and places them at the points in the pentagram star, this causes the body to float and start screaming. Thinking there must be some way to communicate with the screaming corpse, the party tries to disguise themselves as cultists and stand around the pentagram, but there is no effect. Then they try to break the ritual star, which is not effective. Bazzert then uses the cursed horn and the screaming corpse starts to play demonic music. After a while the team pulls out the daggers from the corpse's chest, and it speaks to them. He is the protector of the poisons in the fortress and tells the team what he can. Then after trying to free his soul or at least learn how to, the party just break the pentagram ritual and start to leave the fortress.
The Bone Spider

As they cross the bridge over the river, they are attacked by a giant bone spider coming from their freshly dug grave. In the battle Drakham and Krorg nearly die but Bazzert and Spoops defeat the abomination. Then they depart, returning to Demsford.

 Searching For Teddy

The party returns to Demsford after their investigation of the cultist fortress only to find everyone missing, including the child named Teddy they met when they first arrived.
Everyone is Gone

The party returns to Demsford at night to find it abandoned with no signs of people or life. Then the party remembers the child they met before, Teddy, and begin to look for him. Alas, they can't find anyone in the town, so they head up to the cultist temple on the hill and find a lot of crucified corpses, half mutated and twitching, with disgusting bone appendages sticking out of them, but no sign of Teddy.

Everyone heads back to the inn and starts to pack up and leave as Spoops prays to his God Ry-ann for guidance who also said its time to leave. As the rest of the team prep the horse and carriage, Krorg goes back up to the temple to take one last look for Teddy. He finds the temple barred from the inside, but decides to just leave. The party leaves Demsford and heads back to Allford.

 Return to Allford

The party returns to Allford to report back to Illiard about the cultists in Demsford.
Reporting to Illiard at The Castle

Back in Allford, they go to see Illiard at his tower, but are informed by his secretary that Illiard is meeting with the king. Instead of waiting for his return, the party steal a document with an Illiard seal on it, and bluff their way into the castle. The party are seated in a minor dinning room in the castle while they wait for Illiard to show up.

During the 5 hours that they wait, Krorg and Spoops find a small girl playing under the stairs and play with her to pass the time. Illiard shows up, and after the traumatic events of Demsford, and the lack of information given by Illiard, the party doesn't trust him and try to discern his true intentions. Spoops casts Zone of Truth and gets him to say that he just wants the Old Lich weapons/poisons so he can research them and be able to protect himself and Allford in case they are attacked by such things in the future. The team does have the green liquid vial, but they don't tell Illiard about it. Illiard also gives the party an urgent new mission, the king has a Beholder in his vault and Illiard asks the party to deal with it.
Shopping

Then everyone goes shopping viciously haggling with local vendors. Krorg got a bad ass cape, Spoops got plate armor, Drakham spent a lot of money and agreed to an unscrupulous deal for a discount on armor, and Bazzert tries using every weird item he found as a crafting item to try to make a bunch of magic staves even though he already has one and just doesn't use it/doesn't make an attempt to use it.

 The Destruction of Allford

Allford is destroyed by bone spiders after Drakham drinks the vial of green liquid.
Quest to Slay the Beholder

The party had received a quest from Illiard after returning to Allford from Demsford. That quest was to go into the castle vault to kill a sleeping beholder.

Within the vault, the party discovers that a sleeping beholder is a far greater threat than they imagined. They find that as the beholder dreamed of beholders, those dream beholders became real and manifested in reality. Now the party had multiple beholders to deal with.

The first beholder was kept asleep by a magical crown. Removal of the crown would wake the beholder. The plan became to buff Krorg with as many haste and protection spells as possible and have him run in, remove the crown, and escape. The plan was successful and more beholders stopped spawning but the party was still too weak to fight even a single beholder and retreated back to Illiard.

Spoops' mirror shield would prove useful against beholders as it would allow him to deflect their beam attacks at each other.
Illiard is Killed

The party raided a warehouse in Allford and found a Unicorn trapped in a cage. Spoops creates Unitard. Spoops slays and resurrects the soul of a unicorn into the body of Illiard and has them accompany the party. He raises the unicorn's body as a zombie unicorn and brings it with him as well.

Returning to his tower with news on the beholder situation, Illiard is killed by Frederina for seemingly no reason. Her patron, the golden lobster, commands her to slay Illiard and she complies. Krorg attempts to use Illiard's death and the beholder in the vault to cause a credit crisis in Allford's bank. However his efforts are unsuccessful.
Drakham Destroys Allford

After leaving Illiard's tower, the party argues over what to do with the vial of green liquid. They all have various experiments in mind to determine potential uses. Drakham is deeply concerned with the moral directions the party is heading in and goes to report them to the king at his castle.

Krorg chases down Drakham in an attempt to get him to stop his good natured ways, but then Drakham does the unthinkable and drinks the vial of green liquid, which turns out to be bone spider poison!

Drakham turns into bone spiders and this causes more damage to the citizens of Allford than any other plans the rest of the party may have had for the vial. As bone spiders emerge from Drakham, they attack more people, infecting, killing, and multiplying. With the city rapidly becoming overrun with bone spiders, and the party already weakened from their fight against the beholders, the party flees the city. They mount their carriage and head north towards Demsford. As they leave the city, Krorg is already working on his next scheme to use the chaos to his advantage.

 Traveling to Hastow

The party flees the desolated city of Allford for Hastow to the North West as Krorg formulates a new plan.
Meeting Narascus in Demsford

The party retreats north to Demsford on their carriage. They begin a plan to travel to Saragassa by acquiring a ship in Hastow. Krorg privatly begins planning to organize a pirate raid to plunder Allford.

Upon arrival in Demsford and resting at the tavern, they meet Drakham's father Narascus who joins the party. Bazzert detects that Narascus is a truly evil person.

They stop by the church in Demsford where Spoops finds a teddy bear that comforts any who look into its eyes. It contains Teddy's trapped soul. Spoops places it within his ribcage where his heart would be.
Arrival in Hastow

The party then travel to Hastow where they plan to get a ship to take them to Saragassa. Krorg shares his plan with the party to gather a force of pirates to raid Allford. He secretly plots with Bazzert to have him assassinate the pirate king during the raid so they can take the throne.
The Narascene Cult Begins

While in Hastow, Narascus begins preaching the worship of Ry-ann to the people, however he inserts himself into the teachings as a chosen prophet. He manages to get a small devout following during the party's stay. He reveals to Spoops that he actually plans to start his own church and recruit followers for himself instead of just their god. Spoops does not approve and begins his own preaching.

 Preparing For The Great Pirate Raid

The party sails from Hastow to Saragassa. Upon arrival to Saragassa, they do some exploring before beginning preparations for the raid on Allford.
The Deck of Many Things

While on Saragassa, the party finds an ancient ruin with a teleportation circle while exploring the jungle. They believe it to be related to Rathwing's cult.

The party acquires the Deck of Many Things and begins drawing cards.

    Spoops pulls a card and acquires Dio the map.
    Spoops pulls a card and is teleported away, becoming trapped in a crypt and is only freed when the party finds him.

Krorg Begins His Plan

The party arrives at a tavern in Saragassa called The Whore's Nipple. At the tavern, Krorg begins spreading rumors that the Pirate King is going to make a major announcement tomorrow, which many pirates gain interest in. The next day, the Pirate King woke up and heard he was supposed to give a major annoucement but had no idea what was going on, and that is when Krorg approached him with the plan.
Spoops Meets Vesrahaan

After a night of heavy drinking, Spoops ends up drunkenly preaching the good word of Ry-ann while wandering the alleys of Saragassa. He resurrects some random pirates he finds but they have no interest in hearing his sermon. He is approached by one person who wants to hear more, Vesrahaan. She is a Yuan-ti woman from Wegate, who is a faithful worshipper of Ry-ann. They spend the next few hours talking about their shared religion and personal stories.
Krorg's Plan is Put Into Action

The pirate king agrees to the plan to raid Allford and assembles the pirate lords so that the strategizing may begin.

The party meets the Bugbear captain, one of the pirate lords. The pirate fleet mobilizes, departing for Allford. Some of the party sail on the Bugbear captain's ship and others are on Dave Bones' ship.

Bazzert stays behind with a mission from Krorg to assassinate the Pirate King.

Prelude to the Raid

The party is at a low point with Bomb and Illiard dead, Allford destroyed, and no way to track down Rathwing. The party sails off to Saragassa in a search of something to do, and end up in a pirate tavern called The Whore's Nipple. In a moment of madness, perhaps inspired by the latent soul of Garl Glittergold, Krorg realizes that there's a ton of treasure in the vaults of Allford just sitting around waiting for someone to take it. He begins spreading rumors that the Pirate King is going to make a major announcement tomorrow, which many pirates gain interest in. The next day, the Pirate King woke up and heard he was supposed to give a major annoucement but had no idea what was going on, and that is when Krorg approached him with the plan.
The Plan

    The entire Saragassa fleet, with ever Pirate Lord, sails to Allford.
    All battleships bombard the shit out of the ruins of the city to take out as many bone spiders as possible.
    Three teams are dispatched to targetted areas to loot, Illiard's Tower, the marketplace, and the main target: The Allford castle vaults.
    All treasure is brought back to the ships and returned to Saragassa.
    (Secret) Bazzert stays in Saragassa and assassinates the Pirate King, Krorg uses the momentum from the raid to become the new Pirate King.

But as the party would learn, no plan goes completely correct. There were a great number of surprises and difficulties that lead our heroes to near defeat, but with quick thinking and adaptability they prevailed.
The Raid

The plan to raid Allford was announced to great excitement, as the promise of the greatest loot of all time was all the pirates could think of. Right before the sendoff, Krorg approached Bazzert and slipped him the secret of the plan, that in the end a new Pirate King would be appointed and it would be to the party's advantage. Bazzert agreed to stay behind, and took a close role to guard the Pirate King.

Os and Frederina were tasked to assist the pirates in taking the marketplace to be looted, while Spoops, Narascus, and Breezy-E were tasked with taking the castle. Krorg would stay behind to maintain a leadership role. Each team was given a smoke bomb to signal when the area was clear of bone spiders and the recovery teams could move in and steal everything. The treacherous Dave Bones insisted on accompanying the party into the castle.

The fleet arrived in the Allford waterfront and began bombing the crap out of the smouldering ruins. After no movement was seen, the first raiding parties moved in, clearing out remaining bone spiders.

Meanwhile back in Saragassa, the evil Rathwing teleported to an ancient ruin on the island with bone spiders of his own and overran the pirate capital after his spies informed him that Saragassa was unguarded. Bazzert and the pirate king were forced to flee on a boat and sailed for "safety" towards Allford.

Os and Frederina successfully cleared out the market and set off their smoke signal, then went up to the castle to assist the other team. In Illiard's Tower, Freedom, who had been in Allford while it was being destroyed, recognized the situation and decided to go find his old party at the castle. In the castle, the tension was thick as Spoops, Narascus, and Breezy-E hated working alongside Dave Bones and his crew. However once Freedom showed up, things really went off. Dave Bones sought to steal Freedom's soul again and attacked the party's ally, causing Spoops, Narascus, and Breezy-E to "kill him" as Freedom ran away deeper into the castle. Narascus and Spoops cornered Dave Bones in his quarters, skinning and killing him. They threw his remains into the water. Narascus tells Xiphalia and Darfellan the truth about Dave Bones being killed by himself and Spoops. Dave Bone's crew, who also didn't like working with Dave Bones, let this offense slide (they also didn't want to be killed by the party). Down two powerful members, the remaining party struggles against the bone spiders. Upon arrival in the city, Breezy-E is almost immediately killed by two bone spiders. Not willing to let his friend die, Spoops raises him from from the dead as a zombie. He planned to bring him fully back to life, but his god Ry-ann demanded a hefty price to resurrect him, (all your gold, your phoenix, wind amulet, Illiard's arcane focus, and you'll get breezy back), not willing to pay that price he left Breezy-E as a zombie for now. They then decide to let off their smoke signal way too early to call for reinforcements, Krorg realizes something is off and decides to head up to the castle too. With all forces closing in on the castle, things started going very off even without knowing that they no longer had a place to bring the treasure to.

Krorg pulls the Fates card.

Xiphalia gets the orb form freedom and jumps into the well after confirming there is in fact a rope to get out. Xiphalia then tells Os to turn into a fly and scout ahead. Xiphalia says someone should go tell the pirates to head around the castle before coming in so we can "cut off some enemies ahead". Darfellan then signals to Xiphalia to begin. Xiphalia tells freedom to come over here. Darfellan taps on freedom's shoulder, and does his creepy hand crawl gesture. Darfellan pushes freedom into the well. Darfellan starts throwing boxes like mad down the well on freedom. Darfellan covers the well with the rug. Darfellan hugs Xiphalia but Xiphalia loves Dave Bones, his memory makes her cry. Darfellan piles more boxes on top of the well.

Spoops gets dropped down a well by Narascus. The party must find "water from on high" to free him.

Spoops returns and tells Freedom about Illiard's death at the hands of Frederina.
Inside the Vault

Krorg brings 240 battle ready pirates to clear out the remaining bone spiders in Allford castle on his way to the vault. Breezy-E starts using some wishes, and somehow this leads to Dave Bones returning (he does that a lot). The multiple different groups are stuck wandering the maze-like castle searching for the vault, all while fighting off bone spiders and being hunted by a vengeful Dave Bones. Eventually everyone makes it to the vault and inside it's full of treasure, but also a death tyrant, and Dave Bones makes his ambush here. It turned out that the exposure to the bone spiders green fluid turned the dead beholder into a death tyrant. The party fights, but these combined threats seem too much to bear and Breezy-E makes his fateful wish that "the two strongest people he knew were here". This causes Freedom and Rathwing to be teleported inside the vault.

Rathwing, who had no idea how he got there but knows the party, and decides he's going to kill them all.

Xiphalia orders Josh The Drake to spread water over the floor so the party would be able to track where Rathwing teleports.

However, he gets blinded by Freedom, taking away his ability to misty step. During the fight, Breezy-E is able to locate him using his infra-red vision even when he is invisible, and kill him by firing his magical arrow through Rathwing's eye. Before he dies, he name drops Darmuth, and nobody knows who he's talking about. Krorg kills the death tyrant and Spoops slays Dave Bones once more. The party starts gathering all of the treasure in the vault, until Frederina for some reason brings up the fact that she killed Illiard and Freedom overhears this. Krorg, who had lost Bomb in his quest for revenge, tells Freedom not to continue this cycle of violence but Freedom isn't having it and decides to fight Frederina. Frederina's evil lobster deity senses this danger and comes into to give her a massive power up. The party evacuates the vault as these two fight. Outside the vault, Krorg stations 20 pirates armed with crossbows to shoot at "the second person who comes through that door". Fun fact, Knott Em'Portent was one of these ambushers but he isn't relevant again for a while. Frederina escapes the vault with Freedom in pursuit, and as the second person to leave he gets shot dead by the pirates. Frederina's powers leave her and she falls to 0 hp by Krorg's feet. Krorg has the option to kill this obviously evil person but feels bad enough about the death of Freedom and so spares her life. All of the gold is taken to the ships and the fleet departs from Allford back to Saragassa. Spoops stores Freedom/s body in his bag of holding.
Return Journey

On the way back, it is revealed to the party through divine communication that Saragassa has been destroyed by Rathwing and that Bazzert still hasn't killed the pirate king. The party pleas to Ry-ann to smack some sense into Bazzert, which he does. Bazzert then kills the pirate king and throws his body into the ocean where it gets eaten by a dragon turtle. The pirate fleet arrives back to find that Saragassa has also been destroyed by bone spiders, and the pirate king is nowhere to be found. An emergency accord is called on the command ship and the pirate lords need to decide on what to do next. As Krorg submits his bid to become the new pirate king, Dave Bones attempts to board but is silently subdued by Spoops and Narascus. The pirates put to vote and elect Krorg the new pirate king on his merits as the raid leader. As his first course of action, Krorg has the entire fleet sail back to Allford where they will form a new pirate capital combining the names of Allford and Saragassa, knows as ALTRICIA.
The End

It is up to Krorg as pirate king to divide the spoils of the raid in a fair way among the surviving participants. Allford nobles show up and start demanding their money back and Krorg wonders how they even got here. Regardless, each member of the party is given a total of around 128,000 gold each, the pirate lords are paid, the allford nobles have some of their gold returned, and Krorg forgoes his share of the treasure in exchange for a controlling share of the massive 2 million gold fund to rebuild Altricia into a respectable city state once again.

On the night of celebration, the party breaks out the Deck of Many Things, and decides to start pulling cards in their less than sober state. Bazzert pulls the card of ruin, and Krorg informs him that his Pirate accountants made a mistake, and his share of 128,000 gold was left unaccounted for. Angered, Bazzert pulls another card to try and win his money back, but pulls a bad card and gets put into a coma. Os pulls the traitor card. Narascus immediately turns against Os, accusing him of betraying the party. The party begin trying to kill Os, however Spoops steps in and stops them. Spoops wants to hear Os out and doesn't want Os murdered. Os takes this opportunity to run from his friends in Altricia. When Krorg hears the news about Os and Bazzert, he concludes Os must have stolen Bazzert's soul. He then takes Os's share of the treasure and puts a bounty on his head, making him the most wanted man in the world. By sunrise, the members of the party depart each to go their own way for the next few years as a means to use their new treasure. Frederina, stays in the service of Krorg, however Spoops wants nothing to do with the manhunt for Os, so he departs for Wegate. Narascus also departs to lead his growing church in Hastow.
