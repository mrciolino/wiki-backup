# Arrival To Ereriad
The party traveled through the [well of many worlds](/items/Well-Of-Many-Worlds) to [Ereriad](/locations/Ereriad) with the purpose of eliminating all the Devastation Vermin.


## Fighting The Devastation Shark Scorpion
The party went through the well to engage the Devastation Shark Scorpion. During the fight, [Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) was struck by the creature and came close to death. [Bazzdows](/characters/bazzdos) and [Spoops](/characters/spoops) had difficulty piercing the creatures carapace, but when they find weak points were able to do massive damage. During the fight, Spoops managed to sever one of the scorpion's claws. They managed to kill it after a tough fight. 


## Dio Needs to Re-Calibrate
Spoops tried to use [Dio](/items/dio) to chart a course between [Mardun](/locations/Mardun) and [Ereriad](/locations/Ereriad), however Dio was unable to do so. He even tried flyong up into space using his [knife leg](/items/peace-was-never-an-option-dagger), but gave up once realizing it would take a while.


## Goats Dick End
After defeating the creature, they found themselves outside the town of [Goats Dick End](/locations/Ereriad/goats-dick-end). 

The party met the pissed off [mayor](/characters/mayor-of-goats-dick-end) who wanted to bribe the party to kill their useless duke, the party not knowing this man refused.

Spoops brought along the severed claw just in case they ever wanted to use it to create a weapon. Spoops tried to use Dio to find the closest large city, but Dio seemed to need more time to calibrate within this new world. With Dio still calibrating, the party asked around town about the closest city. They found a traveling merchant named [Nut](/characters/bane) who offers to take them along with him to the city of [Hellaress](/locations/Ereriad/Hellaress).
