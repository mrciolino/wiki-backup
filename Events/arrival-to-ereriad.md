# Arrival To Ereriad
The party travel through the well of many worlds to Ereriad with the purpose of eliminating all the Devastation Vermin.


## Fighting The Devastation Shark Scorpion
The party goes through the well to engage the Devastation Shark Scorpion. During the fight, Adalynn is struck by the creature snd comes close to death, Bazzdows and Spoops have difficulty piercing the creatures carapace, but when they find weak points are able to do massive damage. During the fight, Spoops manages to sever one of the scorpion's claws. They manage to kill it after a tough fight. 


## Dio Needs to Re-Calibrate
Spoops tries to use Dio to chart a course between Mardun and Ereriad, Dio is unable to do so. He even tries flyong up into space using his knife leg, but gives up once realizing it would take a while.


## Goats Dick End
After defeating the creature, they find themselves outside the town of Goats Dick End. 

The party meets the pissed off mayor who wanted to bribe the party to kill their useless duke, the party not knowing this man refused.

Spoops brings along the severed claw just in case they ever want to use it to create a weapon. Spoops tried to use Dio to find the closest large city, but Dio seems to need more time to calibrate within this new world. With Dio still calibrating, the party asks around town about the closest city. They find a traveling merchant named Nut who offers to take them along with him to the city of Hellaress.
