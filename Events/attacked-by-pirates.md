# Attacked by Pirates
The party is attacked by pirates while escaping [Kaltrosar Bay](/locations/Mardun/Kaltrosar) aboard the [Robin Trading Company's](/organizations/robin-trading-company) ship.

## Negotiating Travel
The party, other than [Freedom](/characters/freedom), wake up on a trading ship owned by the Robin Trading Company.

After leaving their barrels and being caught, they start a bidding war with the captain for the price of the voyage on his ship. As that devolves into chaos, the party tries to kill him when suddenly the ship is attacked by Orcish pirates.

## Pirates Attack
The party and sailors all team up to fight the pirates. [Os Vrntica](/characters/os) woke up Freedom who came up and finished off the pirates on their ship.


## Krorg vs. Freedom
As the ship's crew fights off the pirate ship, [Krorg](/characters/krorg) fights Freedom with [bomb the bear](/characters/Bomb-the-Bear) and a Cannon. 

All of pirates on the ship are now dead and the fighting is over. After witnessing (and accidentally causing) Freedom's genocidal behavior in Kaltrosar Bay, fearing Freedom would attract the attention of vengeful armies, and being a general Luddite, Krorg decides to use the opportunity to eliminate Freedom.

[Os](/characters/os) and [Drakham](/characters/drakham) both try to stop the fighting, but Krorg is set in his belief that Freedom is a dangerous weapon that the Low Bar Brawlers have only begun to abuse. Os issues an order to Freedom not to kill anyone in the party and to destroy the remaining pirate ships. Seconds later, Krorg starts blasting.

The first shot knocks Freedom deep into the ship, before Drakham casts reduce on the size of the cannon. Hearing Freedom moving below, Krorg and Bomb decide to gain the high ground in the fight by climbing the ship's mast. Drakham successfully charms Krorg to climb back down to the deck. Krorg agrees to surrender, but his sudden change in nature causes him to be bitten by Bomb, ending the spell.


## A Dragon Turtle Arrives
Off the side of the ship, a Dragon Turtle appears and attacks the ships. Freedom jumps aboard the Dragon Turtle and begins riding it, and drives it into the remaining pirate ships, destroying them. Krorg thanks Bomb for saving him, and decides to leave Bomb behind to the safety of the Low Bar Brawlers. Then Krorg runs and dives off of the mast into the water, catching the dragon turtle's tail before being dragged off into the horizon...

The rest of the gang now heads off to [Allford](/locations/Mardun/Allford) with the Captain and his ship.


## On to Allford
The activity on the ship is still hectic. The crew and some of the party help to repair what they can and so some fishing for more food on the voyage to Allford.

After some "hole" fixing shenanigans, Os confronts the Elven task master of the ship who is in fact his cousin [Eugene Vrntica](/characters/eugene-vrntica). Although Os only notices this fact after a short musical battle between the two.
