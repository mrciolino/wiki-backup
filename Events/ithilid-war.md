# The Ithilid War
After massive amounts or planning snd preparation, the final dawn if the final battle arrived. Mortis Lux and the Ithilid menace led by The Emperor clashed in glorious combat.



# The Battle


## Spaghetti Forces
The total Sphagetti elementals (todds and theodores) participating in the battle is: 53,328


## The Plan
During the final war against the Ithilids, the party mustered the full force of Mortis Lux and their allies and devised a plan of attack. Step one of the plan was for Breezy-e and a small elite force to pilot the Penne-trator Missile to the city on the head of the Ithillid's Creature. Then Spoops commanded their warships to form up into three waves, the first would gate into the battlefield and begin a heavy assault on the Nautiloids around the creature. The second wave would engage Nautiloids when needed but would primarily make their way to the creature to engage it and the Ithilids directly, This second wave would carry the party, whos goal was to find and eliminate the Emperor. Finally the third wave would gate in and fly above the Nautiloids, dropping troops to land on enemy ships and engage Ithilids in combat. Spoops also put his paladins in command of the defense of various cities which were being attacked by Nautiloids and tentacles of the creature.


## The Battle Begins
The Ithilid's creature and Nautiloids break through the crystal sphere of Mardun, beginning their attack in multiple cities. Mortis Lux begins the assault on the the creature, and sends squads of ships to each city being attacked on the surface.

During the assault, the party was stationed on their command ship where they blasted through the battlefield using their lasers. Upon their arrival to the city atop the beast's head, they fired all lasers to attempt to tunnel into its brain to kill it. The laser attack caused countless tentacles to emerge from the beast's flesh, ripping their ship apart. Before the ship fell, all aboard managed to mount the Mechatarasque piloted by Bazzdos as they fell into the opening they created in the creature's head. Spoops managed to grab ahold of the main laser and power supply before using Peace Was Never an Option to descend into the city.


## Wegate incursion
10 ships were sent to assist Wegate.

## Within the Ithilid's Creature

Spoops beheld the chaos before him as the tentacles writed and flesh heaved. He tried to contact the party via speaking stone but could not get a message through. He resolved to follow them into the wound and find them, he flew upwards, hauling the massive laser into the air, then redirecting into the wound he fired the laser, dodging tentacles and burjing into the flesh of the beast. He managed to dig his way down, eventually finding a system of tunnels. Rather than waste time exploring he began using the laser to blast his way through. After going deeper he finally accudentally blaster a hole into a wider cavern where he found Knott Emportent and the rest of his party. Together they proceeded deeper into the creature until coming upon the golden lobster who directed them to a portal.

Upon entering the portal, they found themselves in a massive hall within the creature. 

## Ceremorph Zeus

Within the hall they saw crystal pillars encapsulating many old friends. Before they could free them, from the sides of the room emerged two enourmous enemies and an sickening sight, the Ceremorphised head of Zeus emerged from the tunnel below attacking the party.

The two enemies from the side halls were Nihilis, Avatar of Violence, and Corelious, Avatar of Chaos.

During the battle, Spoops did massive damage and was able to eliminate one of the two creatures. Ceremorph-Zeus was far more difficult, especially after Bazzdos accudentally ran into the Emperor's room alone and emerged mind controlled against the party. After finding that Zeus could not be tergeted by attacks and was immune to magic, Spoops sought to weaken him by contacting the Council of gods and asking warning them of his plan. He then used the Pen of Jergal to Kill all worshippers of Zeus. Spoops writes the following:

"all worshippers of zeus are killed, their souls wrenched from their bodies and sent to the afterlife. a letter with insignias indicating immediate importance, bearing the signature of Spoops appear before The Raven Queen's Eyes, It instructs her that Zeus has been overtaken by the Ithilid enemy, and she is to immediately remove his memory from all. A similar letter appears before all members of the council of gods, saying that a letter has been sent to the raven queen with instruction to remove all memory of zeus from all, and that they must provide her immediate assistance in this task or all are at risk of perishing."

The he asked the Raven Queen to begin removing the memories of Zeus from all living and dead, including the Gods. The Council of Gods sat in stunned silence as they realized what Spoops had done. He had just begin the slow agonizing process of "executing" a God. This would slowly begin to drain Zeus's divine power and cause him to fade.
Spoops then realised this "Execution" would not be enough to stop him during the fight. Spoops grabbed the laser and positioned himself opposite Bazzdos with Zeus between them. He then fired his laser, targetting Bazzdos. Zeus who happened to be between them was grazed and injured by this powerful beam of non-magical damage! Then Bazzdos who was riding his Mechatarasque used its Armor plating to deflect the laser back at Spoops who did the same with his Mirror Shield. This "laser ping pong" struck Zeus eith every pass, doing immense damage each time. Eventually Zeus succumbed to his wounds and his divine soul was freed. Zeus thanked Spoops for freeing him before returning home, Spoops flipped that bitch off.

With Zeus defeated, the party freed their remaining friends who were held captive in the crystal pillars, sending them back to HQ via gate. Then they made their way to the next room where the Emperor was waiting.

## The Emperor
Finally the final battle began, the party found themselves at one end of an immense hallway, the Emperor at the other wearing the crown of Karsus, and hundreds of enemies in between. The Emperor gloated that they were too late and began his spell to reshape reality as they wished. The party realized they did not have time to fight through the hall, resist the Ithillid's creatures Abilities, and deal with the emperor's powerful spells. Odin used a powerful spell to forcibly teleport the party, Creature, and Emperor to the elemental plane of chaos near the Spawning Stone. He positioned the creature directly in front of the rapidly growing pillar of matter which impaled the giant creature, killing it. With the giant creature's environmental psionic effects and illusions broken, the party was now free to engage the Emperor directly. 

Knott Emportant was mind controlled by the Emperor, so to prevent his interference with the fight, he was imprisoned by Adalynn within a Hedged Prison. The place he was imprisoned was within the elemental plane of chaos. The condition for his release is as follows: 
"knott emportent must find his honor in the hedge, but if someone on the outside wants to free him, they must travel to the spot of his imprisonment and place a letter assigned to knott emportent, and upon reading the letter, that letter must restore his honor to free him"

Breezy-e mentioned to the party the vision he received long ago about "the crystals" being the weakness of the emperor. They saw the crystals on the crown of Karsus worn by the Emerpor and knew what they had to do. Spoops and the party began their attack, destroying the crystals breaking the power of the crown. This caused the crown to begin pulsing with waves of magical energy. It was clear that the crown would soon explode with devastating power. Spoops enlarged to maximum size to move quickly. He made use of his immense size to maneuver behind the Emperor and stab them with the Spelldrinker blade. This attack combined with the 12th level spell: Divine Command, allowed him to force the Emperor to submit to his will. He demanded the Emperor stop he blast, however the Emperor admitted they would be unable to do so. Out of time, Spoops looked to Breezy-e who spoke "Omae Wa Mou Shindeiru" before beginning a chain attack which executed the Emperor. With only a few moments to spare, Spoops had no time to fly over to the party to gate to safety. He yelled to them "get of here I can take it!" as the blast went off. The rest of the party gated to safety while Spoops was able to negate much of the blast with his anti-magic armor and jump into the Well of his divine realm. The battle was finally over. The Emperor defeated and party safe.
