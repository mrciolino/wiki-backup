# The Ithilid War
After massive amounts or planning snd preparation, the final dawn if the final battle arrived. [Mortis Lux](/organizations/mortis-lux) and the Ithilid menace led by The [Emperor](/characters/Emperor) clashed in glorious combat.



# The Battle


## Spaghetti Forces
The total Sphagetti elementals (todds and theodores) participating in the battle is: 53,328


## The Plan
During the final war against the Ithilids, the party mustered the full force of Mortis Lux and their allies and devised a plan of attack.

Step one of the plan was for [Breezy-e](/characters/breezy) and a small elite force to pilot the [Penne-trator](/items/Penne-trator-Missile) Missile to the city on the head of the Ithillid's Creature. Then [Spoops](/characters/spoops) commanded their warships to form up into three waves. 

The first would gate into the battlefield and begin a heavy assault on the Nautiloids around the creature. 

The second wave would engage Nautiloids when needed but would primarily make their way to the creature to engage it and the Ithilids directly, This second wave would carry the party, whos goal was to find and eliminate the Emperor. 

Finally the third wave would gate in and fly above the Nautiloids, dropping troops to land on enemy ships and engage Ithilids in combat. Spoops also put his paladins in command of the defense of various cities which were being attacked by Nautiloids and tentacles of the creature.

## Mortis Lux Gathers
The party and all commanders of Mortis Lux gathered in the great hall of Mortis Lux HQ to review the plan once more and share a final bowl of spaghetti before the battle began. During the gathering Bazzdos called for a speech, to witch Spoops obliged. Spoops spoke over the speaking stone network to all Mortis Lux troops. He spoke of the bravery and courage in each of them. Telling them that the coming battle would determine the fste of the universe and they were the brave few who stood between their worlds and oblivion. He ended his speech with the reminder to fight hard and remember that "Death is never the end".

The gsther was cut short when word csme in over the speaking stone network that [Altricia](/locations/Mardun/Allford) and [Fywick](/locations/Mardun/Fywick) were under attack by giant tentacles in the sky and nautiloids. 


## The Battle Begins
The Ithilid's creature and Nautiloids break through the crystal sphere of [Mardun](/locations/Mardun), beginning their attack in multiple cities. Mortis Lux begins the assault on the the creature, and sends squads of ships to each city being attacked on the surface.

They sent 10 ships each to Fywick and Altricia.

During the assault, the party was stationed on their command ship where they blasted through the battlefield using their lasers. Upon their arrival to the city atop the beast's head, they fired all lasers to attempt to tunnel into its brain to kill it. The laser attack caused countless tentacles to emerge from the beast's flesh, ripping their ship apart. Before the ship fell, all aboard managed to mount the [Mechatarasque](/characters/mechatarasque) piloted by [Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos) as they fell into the opening they created in the creature's head. Spoops managed to grab ahold of the main laser and power supply before using [Peace Was Never an Option](/items/Peace-Was-Never-An-Option-Dagger) to descend into the city.


## Wegate incursion
10 ships were sent to assist [Wegate](/locations/Mardun/Wegate).

## Within the Ithilid's Creature

Spoops beheld the chaos before him as the tentacles writed and flesh heaved. He tried to contact the party via speaking stone but could not get a message through. He resolved to follow them into the wound and find them, he flew upwards, hauling the massive laser into the air, then redirecting his flight into the wound. He then fired the laser, dodging tentacles and burrowing into the flesh of the beast. He managed to dig his way down, eventually finding a system of tunnels. Rather than waste time exploring he began using the laser to blast his way through. After going deeper he finally accidentally blasted a hole into a wider cavern where he found [Knott Emportent](/characters/knott-emportent) and the rest of his party. Together they proceeded deeper into the creature until coming upon the [golden lobster](/characters/emperor) who directed them to a portal.

Upon entering the portal, they found themselves in a massive hall within the creature. 

## Ceremorph Zeus

Within the hall they saw crystal pillars encapsulating many old friends. 

Anticipating a massive fight, Spoops blew the [Divine Horn of Valhalla](/items/divine-horn-of-valhalla), summoning the avatars of [Odin](/characters/odin), [Loki](/characters/loki), and [Thor](/characters/thor).

Before they could free them, from the sides of the room emerged two enourmous enemies and an sickening sight, the Ceremorphised head of [Zeus](/characters/zeus) emerged from the tunnel below attacking the party.

The two enemies from the side halls were [Nihilis, Avatar of Violence](/characters/nihilis), and [Corelious, Avatar of Chaos](/characters/corelious).

The Norse gods were slain miltiple times during the fight. Each time the horn had to be blown again to bring them back.

During the battle, Spoops did massive damage and was able to eliminate one of the two creatures. Ceremorph-Zeus was far more difficult, especially after Bazzdos accudentally ran in fear of Zeus, into the [Emperor's](/characters/Emperor) room alone and emerged mind controlled against the party. After finding that Zeus could not be tergeted by attacks and was immune to magic, Spoops sought to weaken him by contacting the [Council of Gods](/organizations/council-of-gods) and warning them of his plan. He then used the [Pen of Jergal](/items/Feathered-Pen-Of-Jergal) to kill all worshippers of Zeus. Spoops writes the following:

"all worshippers of Zeus are killed, their souls wrenched from their bodies and sent to the afterlife. a letter with insignias indicating immediate importance, bearing the signature of Spoops appear before The [Raven Queen's](/characters/raven-queen) eyes, It instructs her that Zeus has been overtaken by the Ithilid enemy, and she is to immediately remove his memory from all. A similar letter appears before all members of the Council of Gods, saying that a letter has been sent to the Raven Queen with instruction to remove all memory of Zeus from all, and that they must provide her immediate assistance in this task or all are at risk of perishing."

The he asked the Raven Queen to begin removing the memories of Zeus from all living and dead, including the Gods. The Council of Gods sat in stunned silence as they realized what Spoops had done. He had just begun the slow agonizing process of "executing" a God. This would slowly begin to drain Zeus's divine power and cause him to fade.

Spoops then realised this "Execution" would not be enough to stop Zeus during the fight. Spoops grabbed the laser and positioned himself opposite Bazzdos with Zeus between them. He then fired his laser, targetting Bazzdos. Zeus who happened to be between them was grazed and injured by this powerful beam of non-magical damage! Then Bazzdos who was riding his [Mechatarasque](/characters/mechatarasque) used its armor plating to deflect the laser back at Spoops who did the same with his [Mirror Shield](/items/Mechanical-Mirror-Shield). This "laser ping pong" struck Zeus with every pass, doing immense damage each time. Eventually Zeus succumbed to his wounds and his divine soul was freed. Zeus thanked Spoops for freeing him before returning home, Spoops flipped that bitch off.

With Zeus defeated, the party freed their remaining friends who were held captive in the crystal pillars, sending them back to HQ via gate. Then they made their way to the next room where the Emperor was waiting.

## The Emperor
Finally the final battle began, the party found themselves at one end of an immense hallway, the Emperor at the other wearing the [Crown of Karsus](/items/crown-of-karsus), and hundreds of enemies in between. The Emperor gloated that they were too late and began his spell to reshape reality as he wished. The party realized they did not have time to fight through the hall, resist the Ithillid's creatures abilities, and deal with the Emperor's powerful spells. [Odin](/characters/odin) used a powerful spell to forcibly teleport the party, Creature, and Emperor to the [elemental plane of chaos](/locations/elemental-plane-of-chaos) near the [Spawning Stone](/locations/elemental-plane-of-chaos/spawning-stone). He positioned the giant creature directly in front of the rapidly growing pillar of mithril crystal which impaled and killed them as it grew. With the giant creature's environmental psionic effects and illusions broken, the party was now free to engage the Emperor directly. 

Knott Emportant was mind controlled by the Emperor, so to prevent his interference with the fight, he was imprisoned by [Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) within a Hedged Prison. The place he was imprisoned was within the elemental plane of chaos. The condition for his release is as follows: 
"Knott Emportent must find his honor in the hedge, but if someone on the outside wants to free him, they must travel to the spot of his imprisonment and place a letter assigned to Knott Emportent, and upon reading the letter, that letter must restore his honor to free him"

[Breezy-e](/characters/breezy) mentioned to the party the vision he received long ago about "the crystals" being the weakness of the Emperor. They saw the crystals on the crown of Karsus worn by the Emerpor and knew what they had to do. Spoops and the party began their attack to destroy the crystals to stop the power of the crown. Spoops [enlarged](/items/Ring-Of-Magnificent-Size) to maximum size to move quickly. Spoops looked to Breezy-e who spoke "Omae Wa Mou Shindeiru" before beginning a chain attack which destroyed the crystals on the crown of Karsus, stopping the Emperor's reality warping spell. However, the crown was still pulsing fast with unstable magical energy, it was going to blow. Spoops made use of his immense size to maneuver behind the Emperor and stab them with the [Spelldrinker Blade](/items/Spelldrinker-Blade). This attack combined with the 12th level spell: [Divine Command](/Spells/Divine-Command), allowed him to force the Emperor to submit to his will. The command he issued is as follows: "obey all further commands issued by Spoops or his friends who are members of the [Low Bar Brawlers](/organizations/low-bar-brawlers), so long as they are not mind controlled, charmed, or otherwise not in control of their minds upon issuing said commands."


He demanded the Emperor stop the blast, however the Emperor admitted they would be unable to do so. Out of time, with only a few moments to spare, Spoops had no time to fly over to the party to gate to safety. He yelled to them "get of here I can take it!" as the blast went off. The rest of the party gated to safety while Spoops was able to negate much of the blast with his [anti-magic armor](/items/Anti-Magic-Armor) and jump into the [Well](/locations/The-Well-Of-Souls) of his divine realm. The battle was finally over. The Emperor defeated and party safe.
