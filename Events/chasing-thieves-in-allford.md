# Chasing Thieves in Allford
After arriving in Allford and looming for more work, the party is robbed.

## Arrival in Allford
After a three day voyage the party arrives to Allford and immediately get referred by Captain John Robin of the Seabird to The West Sorea Trading Company for more work. However Otto and Frederina were immediately pickpocketed and were out to get their money back.

After Kiwi read some thieves cant and they saw the thief head to the park and down a cave entrance then Bazzert almost set the park on fire as he produce flames while inside a bush

The gang of course put out the fire by Urinating on a bear rug and throughing it upon the burning bush

Drakham is first however in finding the thief and sneaks up on him and scares the pickpocket the corrupt guards in the thief tunnel and get the guards to point them in the direction of the thief

Down the sewer they went and through it all they all got covered in excrement and Bazzert almost killed himself and Drakham with more fire in a clod of methane above a pool of poop

After everyone getting covered in crap they found a small entrance staircase leading down and found themselves in tight corridors fighting spiders and zombies in trap filled hallways
