# Chasing Thieves in Allford
After arriving in Allford and looming for more work, the party is robbed.

## Arrival in Allford
After a three day voyage the party arrives to Allford and immediately get referred by Captain John Robin of the Seabird to The West Sorea Trading Company for more work. However Otto and Frederina were immediately pickpocketed and were out to get their money back.


## Tracking The Thief to The Sewers
After the robbery, Kiwi found and read some thieves cant, and saw the thief head to the park and down into a sewer tunnel entrance. 

Then Bazzert almost set the park on fire as he produce flames while inside a bush. The party put out the fire by urinating on a bear rug and throwing it upon the burning bush.

Drakham is first to find the thief so he sneaks up on them and scares them. They pickpocket the corrupt guards in the thief tunnel and get the guards to point them in the direction the thief ran.

Spoops had been exploring Allford before jouning up with the party, and he noticed that his presence seemed to piss off everyone in town. He learns that undead are hated because of a decades long conflict that ended 25 years ago called the Necrotic Wars, and that to this day people still hate the undead.

The party then went down in the sewer, getting covered in excrement. Bazzert almost killed himself and Drakham using more fire while in a cloud of methane above a pool of poop.


## Secret Dungeon in The Sewer
After everyone got covered in crap they found a small entrance with a staircase leading further down. They found themselves in a tight corridor, then fighting spiders and zombies in trap filled hallways.

Drakham and Bazzert are cornered by a pack of Spiders and Drakham justs annihilates them with his magical abilities.

Then the party finds the lost halfing pickpocket and drag him along through halways of trap filled, skeleton filled danger.

Os Vrntica follows up this excitement with a calming ballad which reinvigorate the party and prepares them for the rest of the dungeon, the likes of which are filled with a gelatinous cube, more spiders, and a Wall of Fire.

The gang finds a mysterious wall of fire and weird paintings that light up with proper activation, but before figuring out the mystery they have to deal with a mimic.

And then BOOM in from the outside and out of nowhere Krorg re-enters the fray and with a pirate crew with one goal to kill Freedom

After some introductions and re-introductions Krorg's crew dispel the wall of fire and are ready to move on to the dungeon exit.
