# Chasing Thieves in Allford
After arriving in Allford and looming for more work, the party is robbed.

## Arrival in Allford
After a three day voyage the party arrives to Allford and immediately get referred by Captain John Robin of the Seabird to The West Sorea Trading Company for more work. However Otto and Frederina were immediately pickpocketed and were out to get their money back.


## Tracking The Thief to The Sewers
After the robbery, Kiwi found and read some thieves cant, and saw the thief head to the park and down into a sewer tunnel entrance. 

Then Bazzert almost set the park on fire as he produce flames while inside a bush. The party put out the fire by urinating on a bear rug and throwing it upon the burning bush.

Drakham is first to find the thief so he sneaks up on them and scares them. They pickpocket the corrupt guards in the thief tunnel and get the guards to point them in the direction the thief ran.

The party then went down in the sewer, getting covered in excrement. Bazzert almost killed himself and Drakham using more fire while in a cloud of methane above a pool of poop.

After everyone got covered in crap they found a small entrance with a staircase leading further down. They found themselves in a tight corridor, then fighting spiders and zombies in trap filled hallways.
