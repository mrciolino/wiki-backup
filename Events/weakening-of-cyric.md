# Weakening of Cyric
Bazzdos has created a powerful new spell called Mordenkainen's Disjunction which he plans to use to break Cyric's hold over the sword Godsbane. 

## Initial Investigation
The party investigates Breezy-E's sword Godsbane. Breezy communes with the blade and discovers that it is not the god Mask lretending to be a sword, but is instead the imprisoned form of Bhaal. Bhaal offers to make a deal with Breezy-e, freedom in exhange for power. Breezy-e gladly accepts.

## Bazzdos Rends Cyric's Soul
Bazzdos uses Mordenkainen's Disjunction to destroy Cyric's connection to the blade by rending the part of his soul inhabiting it. Spoops and Bhaal race to grab whatever they can of Cyric's soul. Bhaal gets some, but Spoops gets most of it which he provides to the party as power. Bhaal departs but first grants Breezy-E his blessing, becoming the second "Death God" to do so. Breezy hangs on to the sword now that Cyric's influence has been removed.
