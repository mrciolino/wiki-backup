# Weakening of Cyric
Bazzdos has created a powerful new spell called Mordenkainen's Disjunction which he plans to use to break Cyric's hold over the sword Godsbane. 


## Spoops Gathers Materials For Imprisoning Kronos
Spoops uses the pen of Jergal to ensure the party have everything they need to reinforce the imprisonment of Kronos once the war is over. He writes the following:
"The following list of materials will be acquired from worlds throughout the multiverse, the planes, the heavens and the hells, so that no single world is affected more than any other, and so that no inhabitants of any of these worlds are found wanting of these listed materials. rare soporific herbs, and every kind of metal and gem. The amount of each material is to be the amount required for each condition of the spell imprisonment to be cast on cronos the titan three times. all these materials are to be safely deposited within the vault of wegate, the demiplanes that adalynn keeps her treasure, and in the dungeons of adalynn's island fortress."

The materials are successfully gathered within the designated locations.

## Initial Investigation
The party investigates Breezy-E's sword Godsbane. Breezy communes with the blade and discovers that it is not the god Mask lretending to be a sword, but is instead the imprisoned form of Bhaal. Bhaal offers to make a deal with Breezy-e, freedom in exhange for power. Breezy-e gladly accepts.

## Bazzdos Rends Cyric's Soul
Bazzdos uses Mordenkainen's Disjunction to destroy Cyric's connection to the blade by rending the part of his soul inhabiting it. Spoops and Bhaal race to grab whatever they can of Cyric's soul. Bhaal gets some, but Spoops gets most of it which he provides to the party as power. Bhaal departs but first grants Breezy-E his blessing, becoming the second "Death God" to do so. Breezy hangs on to the sword now that Cyric's influence has been removed.
