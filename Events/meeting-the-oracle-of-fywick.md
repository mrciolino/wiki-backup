# Meeting The Oracle of Fywick

## The Meeting Begins
The party enters the massive temple on the hill in the center of Fywick and are escorted by a priestess to meet the Oracle.


## The Oracle's Vision
The Oracle foresees that to survive the coming trials and conflict with Darmuth, they must seek out an ancient artifact at the Bastion of Tiyamani The Awesome. 

## Honk
During their meeting, the party was attacked by a Demonic Goose wielding a magic dagger. The Goose spoke the activation phrase "Peace was never an option" and the dagger was sent flying at the party. After defeating the Goose, Spoops took the dagger and spoke the phrase. Spoops managed to hold onto the dagger as it shot through the window next to him and he was dragged through the air to the island in the middle of the city where he met the Parrot Shogunate. After a brief conversation with these talking parrots Spoops returned to the party.


## Frederina's Betrayal
After battling the demon goose and knowing Frederina's demonic allegiances, Meade challenges Frederina to a duel. Frederina, is slain by Meade and the party during the fight. Meade then departs the party and creates the "Three Swishes" bar in Fywick.


## Illiard Returns
Spoops fully resurrects Illiard. 
After regaining his senses, and learning of all that transpired since being murdered by Frederina, the party is told by the resurrected Illiard that they are going to need to save the world. The evil Darmuth, thought long defeated, who has returned to the living world, is a threat to all who live in it. After this, the party realizes the severity of the situation, Darmuth is not simply a mere cultist to be killed for revenge, but is a world ending evil who must be slain for the good of the world.
