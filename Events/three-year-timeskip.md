After celebrating a successful raid, the party splits off for 3 years.

Krorg rules over Altricia and thr pirates of Saragassa.

 **2 BC:** Birth of **[Krorgfrey](/characters/krorgfrey)** to Krorg and his wife Kayla.


## Os Vrntica
[Os Vrintia](/characters/os) is exiled to [Gothriathon](/locations/Mardun/Gothriathon) after Krorg puts the largest bounty in the world on his head after his seeming betrayal.

Despite his bounty, Os becomes the secret ruler and law enforcer of [Gothriathon](/locations/Mardun/Gothriathon). He disconnects Gothriathon from the [Dragon Sea](/locations/Mardun/dragon_sea) trade network back into a barter economy, putting a major wrench in Krorg's economic ambitions.

On a fateful journey for the Robin Trading Co, Os' brother Eugene Vrintia is eaten by a dragon turtle.

## Spoops

[Wegate Revolution](/Events/wegate-revolution).


## Breezy-E
