# Adventures in The Dragon Sea
The party makes a few stops in the Dragon sea while on their way to [Wegate](/locations/Mardun/Wegate).


## Resolving To Free Wegate
The party decide to travel to Wegate to finish [Spoops'](/characters/spoops) rebellion. They begin flying towards Wegate, going east over the dragon sea.


## Dragon Turtling Aku
The party decide to take out [Breezy-E's](/characters/breezy) enemy [Aku](/characters/aku). Aku is slain at the [stronghold of fiery ruin](/locations/Mardun/stronghold-of-fiery-ruin). The party is able to take him out by true polymorphing some small creatures into dragon turtles as they are dropped from the ship onto his castle. The massive impacts from the dragon turtles caused massive explosions, obliterating the castle and enlarging the caldera of the volcano.


## Dave Bones Rematch
[Dave Bones](/characters/Dave-Bones) is encountered as a big bone monster on an island in the dragon sea to the east of Waford castle. The party slays him once again, destroying his body and soul. Or so they think!


## Dragon Treasure Under The Sea
While flying over the dragon sea, the party finds treasure in an old dragon hoard under the Dragon Sea. They fill a demi plane with gold, jewels, and magic items.
