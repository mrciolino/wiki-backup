# The Ice Castle of Bahyrst
The party travels to the city of [Bahyrst](/locations/Mardun/Bahyrst) to investigate the castle [Spoops](/characters/spoops) was granted by the [deck of many things](/items/Deck_Of_Many_Things). Upon arrival they discover the castle has been taken over by an evil wizard named [Fiad](/characters/fiad). 

The party meets [Tamara Strenger](/characters/tamara-strenger), another member of the Guardison family.

## Otto Hurtzog Captures Narascus and Arrival in Bahyrst
The party encounters [Otto Hurtzog](/characters/Otto-Hurtszog) accompanied by a group of ice devils on their way north to Bahyrst. Otto opens fire on the party from below attempting to take out [Os](/characters/os). The party was outmatched and forced to retreat. Despite their best efforts, [Narascus](/characters/Narascus) was captured, and for a moment they worried he was dead.

After locating him with [Dio](/items/dio), Os and Spoops were able to save Narascus, fighting off frost giants long enough for Os to teleport him out of the ice castle of Bahyrst, though they were off target. Luckily, Os was able to Polymorph into a dragon and carry everyone to safety.


## Defeating The Flying Beast
After finally returning to the ship, a massive flying beast was attacking the rest of the party. Os, having had enough for the day, used Eyebite to put the beast to sleep, causing it to fall into the icy city below. The citizens, discovered earlier to be werebeasts and having transformed, began attacking and eating the beast. The party fled to rest.

## The Lycanthropy Problem and Start of Spoops' Paladin Order
When the party found out from the innkeeper that there was an outbreak of lycanthropy in the city, and the townsfolk were being oppressed by the wizard Fiad who recently took over the castle, the party rallied the townsfolk around the filthy fountain in the middle of town, where Spoops made a proposal. Spoops displayed his [Paladin](/classes/oath-of-the-soulwarden) power by purifying and blessing the polluted water from the fountain and using the new Holy Water to cure one of the lycanthropes. Then he called out to the crowd looking for new recruits to worship and train under him, it was [Kierkegaard](/characters/kierkegaard) who was first to volunteer. A few other citizens stepped forward to become paladins, namely [Ghazali](/characters/ghazali), [Niebhur](/characters/niebhur), [Tilich](/characters/tilich), [Luther](/characters/luther), and [Wolterstoff](/characters/wolterstoff). Spoops trained them in the basics and together they permanantly purified the cities water.


## Mort Joins The Party
The party returned to the city in an attempt to capture Otto and get information from him. While flying over the arctic on their way back to Bahyrst, they met an assassin named [Mort](/characters/mort), disguised as an eccentric old human man with surprising nimbleness and a killer instinct. Given his goal of defeating [Darmuth](/characters/Darmuth) aligns with the party, he is welcomed to join up.


## Capturing Otto Hurtzog
With a new friend to help, the party assaulted the mountain north of the town where Otto had allied himself with ice giants. Managing to pry Otto out of the defensive formation of the giants, the party returned to the ship with their prisoner in tow. Otto had his hands sovereign glued to the floor of Narascus' room and is subsequently interrogated by him. After a short session of threats and questioning, the party not only got the information they needed, but recruited Otto to their cause.


## Investigating the Castle
The party then goes to inflitrate the castle. They find the castle to be heavily guarded with magical traps and illusions. Spoops takes a turn into a room alone and finds himself trapped within nested illusions. After activating his [Anti-magic armor](/items/Anti-Magic-Armor) he begins breaking out of the illusions at which point he finds he has been captured and restrained to a chair within a prison cell in the dungeon. With his armor activated, he uses his knife leg and brute force to get out of his cell and retrieve the rest of his weapons. Spoops then flies through the ice devil infested dungeon to rejoin the party. 

The party confront Fiad at the top of the castle's tower. During their fight they are also attacked by a dragon. During the fight with the dragon, Spoops is eaten and has to fight his way out from the inside.

At the end of the battle, Fiad escapes and not even Dio can locate him.

After the party departed the city, Kierkegaard led the newly formed paladin order in training, cleansing sickness and death, recruitment, as well as running the affairs of the city now that Fiad was defeated and Spoops was away.
