# Fort Suro Goblin Mine
The first real quest the party receives after their [brawl at the tavern](/Events/fort-suro-tavern-brawl). The party is tasked by the Captain of the [Fort Suro](/locations/Mardun/Fort-Suro) Guard, [Guardison](/characters/captain-guardison), to eliminate the goblin menace that has taken over the fort's iron mine. The party accepts and gets to work.

## The Quest
Prior to beginning the quest, [Spoops](/characters/spoops) stops at a local church on the way to the mine. His memory still hazy after washing ashore, he knows he is a paladin, but needs to remember what god he served and receive their blessing. Unfortunately he didnâ€™t get the blessing he was looking for from the priests instead he was turned away due to being a skeleton.

The quest began as the party went into the iron mine. They fought the goblins within, and found [Bomb the Bear](/characters/Bomb-the-Bear). 

[Krorg](/characters/krorg) suplexes Bomb the Bear into a chest and carries him out of the mine. As the party is on their way out of the mine, the [goblin captain](/characters/goblin-captain) comes back with a badger and rolls a cannon out and fires it at the party, but they are still in the cave and able to dodge out of the way. [Os](/characters/os) died after being shot by multiple arrows and getting hit by a minecart. However like the fucking gambler he is, [Drakham](/characters/drakham) used his tides of chaos to get himself back up from death and fucked with the winds of magic and reincarnated Os Vrntica back into a high elf.



The party stuffs the goblin captain into the cannon and takes him alive to bring him back to the town guard captain. The guard captain thanks the party and says there is a merchant transport going to a [fishing village](/locations/Mardun/Trelston) towards the major city of [Kaltrosar](/locations/Mardun/Kaltrosar), so the party join them on the journey.


## The Ghostly Pickle
After defeating the goblins and their spoils looted, the party collects their rewards from Captain Guardison in the [Fort Suro](/locations/Mardun/Fort-Suro) barracks. After being a bit disatisfied with their reward, the party narrowly decides against violence. Seeking work, the party join a caravan as an escort which leaves for [Trelston](/locations/Mardun/Trelston) on the way to Kaltrosar in the morning. The party sleeps in [Popes Pub](/locations/Mardun/popes-pub) for free, and Otto is disturbed out of his sleep by a ghostly pickle named [Pickle Rick](/characters/pickle-rick). After waking a couple other people, the party talk with the ghostly pickle and it gives them a clue to Spoops' forgotten past, and that the truth of the matter lies with [Guardison Sr.](/characters/guardison-senior) in Trelston.
