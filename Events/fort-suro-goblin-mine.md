# Fort Suro Goblin Mine
The first real quest the party receives after their brawl at the tavern. The party is tasked by the Captain of the Fort Suro Guard, Guardison, to eliminate the goblin menace that has taken over the fort's iron mine. The party accepts and gets to work.

## The Quest
Prior to beginning the quest, Spoops stops at a local church on the way to the mine. His memory still hazy after washing ashore, he knows he is a paladin, but needs to remember what god he served and receive their blessing. Unfortunately he didnâ€™t get the blessing he was looking for from the priests instead he was turned away due to being a skeleton.

The quest began as thr party went into the iron mine. They fought the goblins within, and found Bomb the Bear. Os died to after being shot by multiple arrows and getting hit by a minecart. However, Drakham uses a wild magic surge and Os randomly gets resurrected, luckily as the same race.

Krorg suplexes Bomb the Bear into a chest and carries him out of the mine. As the party is on their way out of the mine, the goblin captain rolls a cannon out and fires it at the party, but they are still in the cave and able to dodge out of the way.

The party stuffs the goblin csptain into the cannon and takes him alive to bring him back to the town guard captain. The guard captain thanks the party and says there is a merchant transport going to a fishing village towards the major city of Kaltrusar, and we should join them on the journey.
