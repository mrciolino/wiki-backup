# Invading Darmuth's Lair
The party traverse a sprawling dungeon as they search for Darmuth's lair.

## Entering The Dungeon
The party is in some dungeon somewhere.


## Giant Skeleton
Spoops finds a bunch of corpses and makes a bone giant. The bone tiant accompanies them for a short time, however it is too large to fit through the doors and must be left behind.


## Looting Magic Items
The party takes out some soldiers loyal to Darmuth. They find many magic items after looting their bodies:
- flask that turns things inside into wine
- Balagor's Orb of anti-annihilation
- belt of useful storing
- shifty abacus (shady and unreliable)
- silver gauntlet
- cool sunglasses

## Mirror Door
The party encounters a magic mirror that shows a version of you that is oppositely aligned. 

After Spoops stepped in front of the door, an evil copy of him appeared.




## The Mummy Lords
The party passes a room of mummy lords unscathed as Spoops is able to communicate with them. Being highly intelligent undead, they understand the authority the undead Spoops holds over their kind, so they allow the party to pass.


## Portal to Darmuth's Lair
At the end of the dungeon, the party finds a portal leading to Darmuth's lair.
