# Arrival in Trelston
The party arrives in the small fishing village of Trelston. They get involved in some situations with the local barkeep, a horrible creature, and badgers.

## The Patron
On the village dock, Frederina met her warlock patron. A giant faceless tentacled thing which she now serves.

2. Bazzert almost started a fight with the locals over them not having a magic staff for him to buy

3. Drakham's magic was still Eff'd so he was just doing random spell effects and clutching things

4. the gang went to the barkeep guardisson talked about and absolutely freaked him out and chased him around town but got him to give up the info Spoops needed

5. Spoops met guardisson then tried to kidnap him then rob him and then desecrated a shrine (he was a chaotic good paladin) for a magic necklace which had no importance in the grand scheme of things

6. said desecration caused a swarm of badgers to attack the group

7. box bear was befriended and tamed by OS then Krorg

8. Frederina set the forest ablaze and after 20 minutes kiwi took it upon himself to get people to help the guards put out the fire

9. box bear joined the group and was named bomb the bear

10. next session will leave the small fishing village of trelston
