# Arrival in Trelston
The party arrives in the small fishing village of Trelston. They get involved in some situations with a guardison, a horrible creature, and badgers.

## The Party Take Care of Individual Things
While in the village, the party have very different ideas on what to do next. On the village dock, Frederina met her warlock patron. A giant faceless tentacled thing which she now serves.

Bazzert almost started a fight with the locals over them not having a magic staff for him to buy

Drakham's wild magic was still Eff'd so he was just casting random spell effects and clutching things.

Krorg managed to tame and befriend the Bear in the box. After befriending him, Krorg renames him Bomb the Bear.

## Guardison Senior
The party went to the barkeep Guardison the guard talked about, and absolutely freaked him out and chased him around town but got him to give up the info Spoops needed.

Spoops met Guardison Senior outside the lighthouse. Then Spoops tried to kidnap him and rob him to obtain his magic Wind Amulet. Guardison was able to mostly evade Spoops when he used the pwoer of the wind amet to bypass the powerful gale force winds blocking the path to the lighthouse. However Spoops eventually prevails and gets the amulet from him. Drakham ends up getting his hands on the amulet from Spoops and deposits it in a donation box at a shrine in the forest. Spoops reaches in and grabs the amulet back, accidentally desecrating the shrine.

This action caused a swarm of badgers to appear and attack the group. As they attacked, the badgers chanted "Badger Badger Badger".

During the fight, Frederina set the forest ablaze and after 20 minutes kiwi took it upon himself to get people to help the guards put out the fire. 

After causing absolute chaos and harassing the villagers, the party leaves town and heads to Kaltrosar Bay looking for work.
