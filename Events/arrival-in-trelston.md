# Arrival in Trelston
The party arrives in the small fishing village of Trelston. They get involved in some situations with a guardison, a horrible creature, and badgers. Upon arrival the caravan pays the party for their protection.

## The Party Take Care of Individual Things
While in the village, the party have very different ideas on what to do next. 

Frederina, Os, and Drakham hang around the docks. Suddenly Frederina's patron, a giant faceless tentacled golden lobster, appears to Frederina. A void portal opens, and Os and Drakham join Kat in jumping into the void, encountering lots of teeth and evil patron vibes. Federina accepts servitude to her patron. Os and Drakham agree to help her out as well.

Bazzert almost started a fight with the locals over them not having a magic staff for him to buy

Drakham's wild magic was still Eff'd so he was just casting random spell effects and clutching things.

Krorg managed to tame and befriend the Bear in the box. After befriending him, Krorg renames him Bomb the Bear.

## Guardison Senior
The party went to the tavern in town called "The Wispy Rat". Guardison the guard talked about, and absolutely freaked out the bartender and chased him around. Eventually he introduces himself as Guardison Sr. and tells Spoops what he knows.


Guardison Sr. tells Spoops that there was a Paladin named Spoops during the Lich Wars who departed on a ship from Trelston but was betrayed by his own crew and drowned at sea.

Spoops then tried to kidnap and rob Guardison Senior outside the lighthouse to obtain his magic Wind Amulet. Guardison was able to mostly evade Spoops when he used the power of the wind amet to bypass the powerful gale force winds blocking the path to the lighthouse. However Spoops eventually prevails and gets the amulet from him. 


## Badger Badger Badger
The Wind Amulet needs to be recovered so Gaurdison can man the lighthouse, but Spoops really wants it. The party goes to get it; Drakham gets it first and places it in a lockbox at the nature shrine. Spoops breaks into the lockbox, angering the spirit who summons badgers. In response, Federina sets the forest on fire.

This action caused a swarm of badgers to appear and attack the group. As they attacked, the badgers chanted "Badger Badger Badger".

During the fight, Frederina set the forest ablaze and after 20 minutes kiwi took it upon himself to get people to help the guards put out the fire. 

After causing absolute chaos and harassing the villagers, the party leaves town and heads to Kaltrosar Bay looking for work.
