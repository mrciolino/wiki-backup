# Chaos in Kaltrosar
The party arrives in [Kaltrosar Bay](/locations/Mardun/Kaltrosar) looking for work. However, with no clear quest, their visit deteriorates into chaos. 


## Disguising Bomb 
Prior to arriving in Kaltrosar, [Krorg](/characters/krorg) dressed up [Bomb the bear](/characters/Bomb-the-Bear) to disguise him so he could get him in to human places. 

## Rejected From Kaltrosar Castle
The group arrives at Kaltrosar Bay, gets paid for eliminating some bandits on their way, and looks for more work. First they go to the castle looking for work, but that doesn't work out because Krorg brought a bear which gets them kicked out. 

## Hired to Clean The Sewers
Then they head to the merchant's guild where they get a job to clear out the sewers of Kaltrosar bay.

## Bazzdrt Tries to Infiltrate The Castle
While this was happening, [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) had transformed into a squirrel and infiltrated the castle himself. However Bazzert screws up his disguise as a squirrel and is led to the dungeon.

## Frederina Gets Arrested
[Drakham](/sessions/campaign_1/overview) and [Krorg](/characters/krorg) later get inside the castle with [Otto](/characters/Otto-Hurtszog), and [Frederina](/characters/Frederina). However Frederina gets arrested for touching the soft hands of the prince of kaltrosar.


## An Attempt Was Made to Actually Do The Sewer Quest
Krorg, Drakham, and Otto get a lieutenant of the guards to lead them to the sewer access in the castle's dungeon where they meet up with the imprisoned Bazzert and Frederina.

With half the party imprisoned, Drakham tries valiantly to unfuck the situation by attempting to persuade the guards that they are here to check the security of the castle, and they failed this inspection by letting the party in, the guards don't buy this lie.


## Things Escalate
The group gives in and is arrested but then Drakham accidently kills lord Barrymoore in one hit. Then more guards arrive directly from the king of Kaltrosar. Bazzert angers the guards so they try to kill him.

After fighting through a large meaty man, the group frees themselves from the dungeon and Freedom gets their stuff back. 


## The City Burns
Then Freedom sets fire to the castle, and as the group escapes they gather [Os](/characters/os), [Seiriphi](/characters/Seiphiri), [Spoops](/characters/spoops), and [Kiwi](/characters/Kiwi).

The group escapes by distracting dock workers with free beer while freeedom set fire to the dock before they everyone stowed away in cargo crates on a ship owned by the [Robin Trading Company](/organizations/robin-trading-company) who was leaving Kaltrosar Bay.
