# Chaos in Kaltrosar
The party arrives in Kaltrosar Bay looking for work. However, with no clear quest their visit deteriorates into chaos. 


## Disguising Bomb 
Prior to arriving in Kaltrosar, Krorg dressed up Bomb the bear to disguise him so he could get him in to human places. 

## Arrival at Kaltrosar Castle
The group arrives at Kaltrosar Bay, gets paid for eliminating some bandits on their way, and looks for more work. First they go to the castle looking for work, but that doesn't work out because Krorg brought a bear which gets them kicked out. Then they head to the merchant's guild where they get a job to clear out the sewers of Kaltrosar bay.

While this was happening, Bazzert had transformed into a squirrel and infiltrated the castle himself.

Drakham and Krorg later get inside the castle with Otto, and Frederina.

Frederina gets arrested for touching the soft hands of the prince of kaltrosar.

Bazzert screws up his disguise as a squirrel and is led to the dungeon.

Krorg, Drakham, and Otto get a lieutenant of the guards to lead them to the sewer access in the castle's dungeon where they meet up with the imprisoned Bazzert and Frederina.

Drakham tries valiantly to unfuck the situation by attempting to persuade the guards that they are here to check the security of the castle, and they failed this inspection by letting the party in, the guards don't buy this lie.

The group gives in and is arrested but then Drakham accidently kills lord Barrymoore in one hit.

then more guards straight from the king of Kaltrosar, Bazzert angers the guards and They try to kill Bazzert so combat

After fighting through a large meaty man the group frees themselves, and freedom and get their stuff back and Freedom sets fire to the castle and as the group escapes they gather Os, Seiphiri, Spoops, and Kiwi and escape.

they escaped by distracting dock workers with free beer and by freeedom setting fire to the dock and everyone stowed away in cargo crates and got on a ship leaving Kaltrosar Bay
