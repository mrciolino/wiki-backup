# Waking Bazzdows
The party returned to [Gothriathon](/locations/Mardun/Gothriathon) to find the council investigating a strange robotic being found buried beneath the city.


## Bazzdows Awakens
The party returned to Gothriathon where the dwarven council found what appeared to be a metallic homunculus which they were studying and arguing over. The metallic being glowed slightly and could snap itself back together when manipulated. As the party investigated, [Spoops](/characters/spoops) found a panel of keys and a screen which prompted him to enter a name. Missing the Bazz brothers, he entered the name [Bazzdows](/characters/bazzdos). The creature awoke and introduced itself as Bazzdos. Intrigued, the rest of the party tried entering things too, particulary [Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) and [Os](/characters/os) who try entering commands saying to "leave to another world" and "be gone from this world" seemingly afraid of the possibility Bazzdos was some sort of invader. Luckily Bazzdos was friendly to the party, and after [Bazzalt](/characters/Bazzalt) left, they needed a new member to join them. So Bazzdos joined the party and they immediately left for [Ereriad](/locations/Ereriad).
