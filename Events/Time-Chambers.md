# Time Chambers

Created during the later seasons of Campaign 1, Bazzdos and Spoops began crafting ultimate weapons for Mortis Lux. With the Ithilid threat looming, they lacked timeâ€”so they devised a new solution: the Time Chambers. Each chamber compresses 5,000 years of time into mere moments outside, granting its occupant the power to train, craft, and evolve beyond mortal limits.
