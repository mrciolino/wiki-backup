# Time Chambers

Created during the later seasons of Campaign 1, Bazzdos and Spoops began crafting ultimate weapons for Mortis Lux. With the illithid threat looming, they lacked time—so they devised a new solution: the Time Chambers. Each chamber compresses 5,000 years of time into mere moments outside, granting its occupant the power to train, craft, and evolve beyond mortal limits.

## Overview

| Chamber | Components | Duration | 
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Time Chamber 1** | Spoops' Blade + Jörmgander + Shard of Divinity | 5000 years | 
| **Time Chamber 2** | Spoops' Blade + Titanite Blade + Shard of Divinity + Ring of Magnificent Size | 5000 years | 
| **Time Chamber 3** | Enhanced Shard of Divinity + Lasers + Lens | 5000 years |
