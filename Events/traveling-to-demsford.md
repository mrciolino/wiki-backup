# Traveling to Demsford
The party departs to make their eay to Demsford to investigste cult activity. 

## Underwater Cavern
Bazzert and Krorg meet with Bazzert's master Ayod in an underwater cave. Ayod has come to tell his estranged student Bazzert that some stars are disappearing from the sky and he doesn't know why. Then Ayod helps train Bazzert to read the weird book.

Krorg resurfaces to see Frederina talking to the golden lobster. Upon closer inspection, he realizes she is entranced by it and doesn't notice Krorg. Os Vrntica and Krorg try to lift the lobster, treating this almost like a competition, but they both fail completely to lift said golden lobster. After all that and having their horses be inconveniently dead, Bomb and Bazzert (transformed into a bear) pull the carriage to Demsford.


## Spoops Makes Haste to Demsford
Four days prior to the rest of the party's arrival in Demsford, Spoops is still in Allford strolling out of a bar when suddenly he hears the voice of the lord, his mysterious God. Spoops' god says "Get your shit together and ride north". Spoops then robs a man passing by of his horse and leaves him on the street. He then rides north out of Allford. He rides for 4 days and gets to Demsford first and then immediately goes to the bar and drink.
