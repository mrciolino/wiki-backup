# Traveling to Hastow
The party flees the desolated city of Allford for Hastow to the North West as Krorg formulates a new plan.


## Meeting Narascus in Demsford
The party retreats north to Demsford on their carriage. They begin a plan to travel to Saragassa by acquiring a ship in Hastow. Krorg privatly begins planning to organize a pirate raid to plunder Alford.

Upon arrival in Demsford and resting at thr tavern, they meet Drakham's father Narascus who joins the party. Bazzert detects that Narascus is a truly evil person.

They stop by the church in Demsford where Spoops finds a teddy bear that comforts any who look into its eyes. It contains Teddy's trapped soul. Spoops places it within his ribcage where his heart would be.


## Arrival in Hastow
The party then travel to Hastow where they plan to get a ship to take them to Saragassa. Krorg shares his plan with thr party to gather a force of pirates to raid allford. He secretly plots with Bazzert to have him assassinate the pirate king during the raid so they can take the throne.



## The Narascene Cult Begins
While in Hastow, Narascus begins preaching the worship ot Ry-ann to the people, however he inserts himself into the teachings as a chosen prophet. He manages to get a small devout following during the party's stay. He reveals to Spoops that he actually plans to start his own church and recruit followers for himself instead of just their god. Spoops does not approve and begins his own preaching.
