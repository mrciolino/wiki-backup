# Traveling to Hastow
The party flees the desolated city of [Allford](/locations/Mardun/Allford) for [Hastow](/locations/Mardun/Hastow) to the North West as [Krorg](/characters/krorg) formulates a new plan.


## Meeting Narascus in Demsford
The party retreats north to [Demsford](/locations/Mardun/demsford) on their carriage. They begin a plan to travel to [Saragassa](/locations/Mardun/Saragassa) by acquiring a ship in Hastow. Krorg privatly begins planning to organize a pirate raid to plunder Allford.

Upon arrival in Demsford and resting at the tavern, they meet [Drakham's](/characters/drakham) father [Narascus](/characters/Narascus) who joins the party. [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) detects that Narascus is a truly evil person.

They stop by the church in Demsford where [Spoops](/characters/spoops) finds a [teddy bear](/items/Teddy-Bear-Heart) that comforts any who look into its eyes. It contains [Teddy's](/characters/teddy) trapped soul. Spoops places it within his ribcage where his heart would be.


## Arrival in Hastow
The party then travel to Hastow where they plan to get a ship to take them to Saragassa. Krorg shares his plan with the party to gather a force of pirates to raid Allford. He secretly plots with [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) to have him assassinate the [pirate king](/characters/pirate-king) during the raid so they can take the throne.



## The Narascene Cult Begins
While in Hastow, Narascus begins preaching the worship of [Ry-ann](/characters/spoops) to the people, however he inserts himself into the teachings as a chosen prophet. He manages to get a small devout following during the party's stay. He reveals to Spoops that he actually plans to start his own church and recruit followers for himself instead of just their god. Spoops does not approve and begins his own preaching.
