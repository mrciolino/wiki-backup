## Selune's Gathering
Os is invited to a gathering in Selune's divine realm to discuss the Spoops problem. The party go to Selune's divine realm, Spoops is convincingly disguised as "Spencer". 

Spoops, Adalynn, and Elira are caught looking for powerful magic in Selune's library by Selune herself. Spoops deflects Selune's moonbeam attacks and eacapes to another planet. They find themselves on a floating island kingdom inhabited by half-dragon people ruled by Faaspraanaam (child of Bahamut and Tiamat) through the Well of Many Worlds with Elira.

Os Adalynn and Bazzdows are brought before the Goddess Selune. Os is confronted by a furious Selune who is trying to convince him to turn against and destroy Spoops and ascend to godhood, joining the pantheon. Os is able to convince her anr Bahamut to give him one last chance to convince Spoops not to ascend to godhood. Selune accepts and grants Os power and allows him to ascend to join the pantheon as a new demigod under herself and her daughter Sune.
