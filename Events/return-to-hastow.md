# Return to Hastow
The party returns to Hastow to investigate possible illithid activity and search for Darmuth's phylactery


## Flight to Hastow
After joining up with Bazzalt, the party journeys to Hastow to search for Darmuth's phylactery and investigate any Illithid activity.

While flying to Hastow, Spoops sees a dragon in the Ethereal plane flying north towards Altricia. It looks like an angry ancient red dragon. It looks like Inferno heading towards Altricia to try to attack Darmuth.


## Hastow Monastary
The party arrives at the Hastow Monastary. Spoops finds some silverware sanctified by Ry-ann. Also he finds a bone from one of the first undead Ry-ann ever raised. Lastly he finds some ancient text written by Ry-ann, all of which he takes.

The party leaves Hastow. Narascus stays behind in Hastow to run his Monastary.
