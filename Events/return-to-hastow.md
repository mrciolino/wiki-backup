# Return to Hastow
The party returns to [Hastow](/locations/Mardun/Hastow) to investigate possible illithid activity and search for [Darmuth's phylactery](/items/darmuths-phylactery).


## Flight to Hastow
After joining up with [Bazzalt](/characters/Bazzalt), the party journeys to Hastow to search for Darmuth's phylactery and investigate any Illithid activity.

While flying to Hastow, [Spoops](/characters/spoops) sees a dragon in the Ethereal plane flying north towards [Altricia](/locations/Mardun/Allford). It looks like an angry chromatic dragon.


## Hastow Monastary
The party arrives at the [Hastow Monastary](/locations/Mardun/hastow-monastary). The cathedral is magically anomated and grows a massive pair of legs. 


Spoops finds some [silverware sanctified by Ry-ann](/items/silverware-sanctified-by-ry-ann). Also he finds a [bone from one of the first undead Ry-ann ever raised](/items/bone-of-ry-anns-first -undead). Lastly he finds some [ancient text written by Ry-ann](/items/ancient-text-of-ry-ann), all of which he takes.


The cathedeal falls, killing [Narascus](/characters/Narascus). [Achilles](/characters/Achilles) decides to mutilate Narascus' body by cutting his dick off. As punishment, the party kills him and resurrects him as a Gnome. Narascus is brought back to life by Spoops. 

The party leaves Hastow to enter the caves below. Narascus stays behind in Hastow to run his Monastary.
