# Return to Hastow
The party returns to Hastow to investigate possible illithid activity and search for Darmuth's phylactery


## Flight to Hastow
After joining up with Bazzalt, the party journeys to Hastow to search for Darmuth's phylactery and investigate any Illithid activity.

While flying to Hastow, Spoops sees a dragon in the Ethereal plane flying north towards Altricia. It looks like an angry ancient red dragon. It looks like Inferno heading towards Altricia to try to attack Darmuth.


## Hastow Monastary
The party arrives at the Hastow Monastary. The cathedral is magically anomated and grows a massive pair of legs. 


Spoops finds some silverware sanctified by Ry-ann. Also he finds a bone from one of the first undead Ry-ann ever raised. Lastly he finds some ancient text written by Ry-ann, all of which he takes.


The cathedeal falls, killing Narascus. Achilles decides ro mutilate Narascus' body by cutting his dick off. As punishment, the party kills him and resurrects him as a Gnome. Narascus is brought back to life by Spoops. 

The party leaves Hastow to enter the caves. Narascus stays behind in Hastow to run his Monastary.
