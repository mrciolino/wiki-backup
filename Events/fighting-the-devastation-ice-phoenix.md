# Fighting The Devastation Ice Phoenix
While hunting for the remaining Devastation Vermin, the party encounters a new Devastation Creature unrelated to the others.

## Narrowly Escaping 
The party locates the devastation Ice Phoenix and battles it atop a mountain. However after seeing its powerful icey abilities first hand, they retreat to do some preparation.


## Prepararing For The Rematch
Adalynn provides glyphs of warding to empower the party, while Bazzdows buys some potions and does some crafting. Once they are prepared. they return to face the beast.


## Fighting The Ice Phoenix
Bazzdows and Adalynn use Wall of Force and Forcecage to trap the phoenix in a demiplane where they can keep it cornered. Spoops keeps up the melee damage while tanking the phoenix, Bazzdows, Adalynn, and Os continue doing ranged attacks. The Ice Phoenix attempts to continuously freeze and shatter the party. Spoops manages to defend against this using his anti-magic armor. The force cage protects the rest of the party.
