# Return To The Plane of Chaos
The party return to the [elemental plane of chaos](/locations/elemental-plane-of-chaos) in another attempt to find a giant gemstone to use to cast imprisonment on [Kronos](/characters/kronos).

## Arrival To The Plane of Chaos
The party teleport to the Elemental Plane of Chaos in search of a titanic gemstone. After they returned from their last trip empty handed due to [Rabiah](/characters/rabiah) owning the resources around the spawning stone they previously found, they go in search of another spawning stone. 

Upon arrival, they see a massive storm of magical energy and material in the distance. They bet that they will find huge stones and gems there, so they teleport once again, this time to the middle of the storm. They assumed there would be a calm eye of the storm, however they were wrong. 


## Bazzdos Is Obliterated
They accidentally arrive in the explosive chaos in the middle of the second Spawning Stone which is a giant torrent of magical energy and material. [Spoops](/characters/spoops) is able to negate the damage using his boon of invincibility, however [Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos) is obliterated. Spoops grabs his soul at the last moment as Adalynn gates them away. Bazzdos asks Spoops to release his soul so that he can return using the clone body [Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) prepared for him. Spoops complies and Bazzdos goes to his new body.
