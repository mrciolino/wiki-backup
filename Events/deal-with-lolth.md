# Deal with Lolth
Spoops and Lolth make a deal to allow Spoops worship among her people, the drow and drider. 

## Finding a City of Drow and Drider
After Bazzdos reaches out to the potion master for a progress report, the party learns that his lab in the underdark was attacked. The party gates to his location to assist and they bring some Mortis Lux soldiers as support. The party runs into a group of Drow and Drider who attack them on sight. The party kills the attackers and has a survivor take them to wherever they came from. They are brought nearby to a city of Drow and Drider where Spoops sees an opportunity to gather followers for himself and Mortis Lux. 

## Coming to an Understanding
Spoops gets to work performing miracles by raising the dead Driders they slew and proclaiming that he is a god controlling life and death. As he begins converting worshippers to his religion, Lolth contacts him angry that he is stealing her followers. Spoops talks to her and explains the Ithilid menace that threatens to destroy all of her followers. He leverages their shared relationship with Shar and offers a joint partnership among her people where she would allow a minor shrine to Spoops to be placed within her temples and Spoops would be able to train some of her people to be clerics and paladins of uis domain. The potion master is relocated to a new heavily guarded lab in the library dimension.
