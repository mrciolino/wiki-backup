## Quest to Slay the Beholder
The party had received a quest from Illiard after returning to Allford from Demsford. That quest was to go into the castle vault to kill a sleeping beholder. Krorg athempts to use this opportunity to cause a credit crisis in Allford's bank. However his efforts are unsuccessful.


## Drakham Drinks the Vial
Upon returning from the vault, the party argues over what to do with the vial of green liquid. They all have various experiments in mind to determine potential uses. Drakham drank the vial of green liquid, turning himself into bone spiders in a desperate attempt to keep the party from doing any further experiments with the vial. This decision caused more damage to the citizens of Allford than any other plans the rest of the party may have had for the vial.
