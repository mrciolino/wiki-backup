# The Destruction of Allford
[Allford](/locations/Mardun/Allford) is destroyed by bone spiders after [Drakham](/characters/drakham) drinks the vial of green liquid.

## Quest to Slay the Beholder
The party had received a quest from Illiard after returning to Allford from [Demsford](/locations/Mardun/demsford). That quest was to go into the castle vault to kill a sleeping beholder. 

Within the vault, the party discovers that a sleeping beholder is a far greater threat than they imagined. They find that as the beholder dreamed of beholders, those dream beholders became real and manifested in reality. Now the party had multiple beholders to deal with. 

The first beholder was kept asleep by a [magical crown](/items/sleep-crown). Removal of the crown would wake the beholder. The plan became to buff [Krorg](/characters/krorg) with as many haste and protection spells as possible and have him run in, remove the crown, and escape. The plan was successful and more beholders stopped spawning but the party was still too weak to fight even a single beholder and retreated back to Illiard.

Spoops' [mirror shield](/items/Mechanical-Mirror-Shield) would prove useful against beholders as it would allow him to deflect their beam attacks at each other.

## Illiard is Killed
The party raided a warehouse in Allford and found a Unicorn trapped in a cage. [Spoops](/characters/spoops) creates [Unitard](/characters/unitard). Spoops slays and resurrects the soul of a unicorn into the body of Illiard and has them accompany the party. He raises the unicorn's body as a zombie unicorn and brings it with him as well.

Returning to his tower with news on the beholder situation, [Illiard](/characters/illiard) is killed by [Frederina](/characters/Frederina) for seemingly no reason. Her patron, the [golden lobster](/characters/Emperor), commands her to slay Illiard and she complies. [Krorg](/characters/krorg) attempts to use Illiard's death and the beholder in the vault to cause a credit crisis in Allford's bank. However his efforts are unsuccessful. 

## Drakham Destroys Allford
After leaving Illiard's tower, the party argues over what to do with the vial of green liquid. They all have various experiments in mind to determine potential uses. Drakham is deeply concerned with the moral directions the party is heading in and goes to report them to the king at his castle. 

Krorg chases down Drakham in an attempt to get him to stop his good natured ways, but then Drakham does the unthinkable and drinks the vial of green liquid, which turns out to be bone spider poison!

Drakham turns into bone spiders and this causes more damage to the citizens of Allford than any other plans the rest of the party may have had for the vial. As bone spiders emerge from Drakham, they attack more people, infecting, killing, and multiplying. With the city rapidly becoming overrun with bone spiders, and the party already weakened from their fight against the beholders, the party flees the city. They mount their carriage and head north towards Demsford. As they leave the city, Krorg is already working on his next scheme to use the chaos to his advantage.
