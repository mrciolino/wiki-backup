# The Destruction of Allford
[Allford](/locations/Mardun/Allford) is destroyed by bone spiders after [Drakham](/characters/drakham) drinks the vial of green liquid.



## Illiard is Killed
The party raided a warehouse in Allford and found a Unicorn trapped in a cage.
[Illiard](/characters/illiard) is killed by [Frederina](/characters/Frederina) for seemingly no reason. Her patron, the [golden lobster](/characters/the-emperor), commands her to slay Illiard and she complies.
[Spoops](/characters/spoops) creates [Unitard](/characters/unitard). Spoops slays and resurrects the soul of a unicorn into the body of Illiard and has them accompany the party. He raises the unicorn's body as a zombie unicorn and brings it with him as well.


## Quest to Slay the Beholder
The party had received a quest from Illiard after returning to Allford from [Demsford](/locations/Mardun/demsford). That quest was to go into the castle vault to kill a sleeping beholder. [Krorg](/characters/krorg) attempts to use this opportunity to cause a credit crisis in Allford's bank. However his efforts are unsuccessful. 

Within the vault, the party discovers that a sleeping beholder is a far greater threat than they imagined. They find that as the beholder dreamed of beholders, those dream beholders became real and manifested in reality. Now the party had multiple beholders to deal with. 

The first beholder was kept asleep by a [magical crown](/items/sleep-crown). Removal of the crown would wake the beholder.

Spoops' [mirror shield](/items/Mechanical-Mirror-Shield) would prove useful against beholders as it would allow him to deflect their beam attacks at each other.


## Drakham Drinks the Vial
Upon returning from the vault, the party argues over what to do with the vial of green liquid. They all have various experiments in mind to determine potential uses. Drakham drank the vial of green liquid, turning himself into bone spiders in a desperate attempt to keep the party from doing any further experiments with the vial. This decision caused more damage to the citizens of Allford than any other plans the rest of the party may have had for the vial. As bome spiders emerge from Drakham, they attack more people, infecting, killing, and multiplying. With the city rapidly becoming overrun with bone spiders, and the party already weakened from their fight against the beholders, the party flees the city. They mount their carriage and head north towards Demsford. As they leave the city,Krorg is already working on his next scheme to use the chaos to his advantage.
