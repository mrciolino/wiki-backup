# Saving The Sun
The party learns that something is wrong with the sun, it appears to be pulsing and dimming. 

## Arrival to the Solar Complex
The party gates to the sun with some ships following behind, and find that the sun actually has a massive castle complex built around it. 

They find the sun is being attacked by a cult who believe that their god is commanding them to destroy all the stars to bring about a new age. This cult is unknowingly serving the Ithilids. 

Adalyn learns that the sun is actually the lair of a powerful ancient solar dragon and its egg, and the Ithilids true goal is to infect and corrupt that egg for their own purposes. 

## Fighting to The Egg
The party works to stop the cult and save the dragon and their egg. The party fights off the cult around the castle as quickly as they can as they realize the cult is performing a ritual that uses some sort of blood sacrifice to force their way into the realm within the sun where the dragon's lair is. 

During the battle Spoops uses his ring to maximize his size, using his giant mirror shield to deflect a powerful solar beam which attacks any flying creatures within the area. Once the party teleports into the lair, Spoops is horrified to find the result of the sacrifice. 



## Within The Sun
The party finds themselves surrounded by a field of millions of roses, each one is the manifestation of the shattered soul of one of the sacrifices. Spoops is devastated by this sight and upon realizing the souls are irreparable, he uses Soul Absorption to put them to a final rest. He distributes this energy among the party, granting them minor boons to help punish those who committed this sin. This solemn use of Soul Absorption gave Spoops the will to seek redemption for guilt he carried after previously using the same spell to obliterate billions of owlbears. 

The party proceeds to the nest of the Solar Dragon where they fight off the enemy and Adalynn is able to make a deal with the Ancient Solar Dragon to become a dragon herself.
