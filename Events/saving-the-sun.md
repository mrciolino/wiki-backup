# Saving The Sun
The party learns that something is wrong with the sun, it appears to be pulsing and dimming. 

## Arrival to the Solar Complex
The party discover an Illithid force is present seound the sun, and they are accompanied by a large group of non-illithid cultists. The party gates to the sun with some ships following behind, and find that the sun actually has a massive castle complex built around it. 

They find the sun is being attacked by a cult who believe that their god is commanding them to destroy all the stars to bring about a new age. This cult is unknowingly serving the Ithilids. 

[Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) learns that the sun is actually the lair of a powerful ancient solar dragon and its egg, and the Ithilids true goal is to infect and corrupt that egg for their own purposes. 

## Fighting to The Egg
The party works to stop the cult and save the dragon and their egg. The party fights off the cult around the castle as quickly as they can. They realize that the cult is performing a ritual that uses some sort of blood sacrifice to force their way into the realm of the dragon's lair within the sun. 

During the battle [Spoops](/characters/spoops) uses his [ring](/items/Ring-Of-Magnificent-Size) to maximize his size, using his giant [mirror shield](/items/Mechanical-Mirror-Shield) to deflect a powerful solar beam which attacks any flying creatures within the area. Once the party teleports into the lair, Spoops is horrified to find the result of the sacrifice. 



## Within The Sun
The party finds themselves surrounded by a field of millions of roses, each one is the manifestation of the shattered soul of one of the sacrifices. Spoops is devastated by this sight and upon realizing the souls are irreparable, he uses [Soul Absorption](/Spells/Soul-Absorption) to put them to a final rest. He distributes this energy among the party, granting them minor boons they can use to help punish those who committed this sin. This solemn use of Soul Absorption gave Spoops the will to seek redemption for his second great sin. He knew he must seek redemption to heal the guilt he carried after previously using the same spell to obliterate billions of owlbears. 

The party proceeds to the nest of the Solar Dragon. Where they fight the enemy. 

The enemy leader managed to infect the solar dragon, and it was now under their control. 

During the battle, Spoops manages to use his ability to cut off the solar drahon from the weave, dropping their magical defenses and making them vulnerable. Adalynn was then able to use wish to cure the dragon and free it from enemy control.

Adalynn is able to make a deal with the Ancient Solar Dragon to become a dragon herself.
