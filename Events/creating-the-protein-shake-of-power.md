# Creating The Protein Shake of Power
[Spoops](/characters/spoops) has an idea for a potion recipe that he believes has the potential to grant the party a power up.

## Protein Shake of Power
After taking inventory of the reagents and supplies he has collected over the years, Spoops has an idea of how to gain even more power. He formulates a recipe for a potion that could potentially grant whoever consumes it massive amounts of power. The party are horrified and intrigued, so they get to work.

One ingredient for the process is the addition of a blessing from the [Raven Queen](/characters/raven-queen), to acquire this the party travels to her [divine realm](/locations/Shadowfell/letherna). The Raven Queen refuses to provide any blessing without payment. Spoops offers her broader access to the memories of souls that pass through his [Well](/locations/The-Well-Of-Souls) in exchange for her blessing and friendship.

With the blessing acquired, the party completes and consumes the [protein shake](/items/Protein-Shake-Of-Power), each of them receiving a personal experience determining the power they gain.

Upon drinking the shake, Spoops once again came into contact with [bomb the bearâ€™s](/characters/Bomb-the-Bear) astral form, then Spoops consumed a sea of magical bomb coin in the astral plane. Then bomb became his summonable spirit. However Spoops knew from his last encounter with astral bomb that they did not want to be bound to anything anymore and simply wished to rest and freely explore the astral plane. So Spoops released bomb from his bindings as both the summonable golden spirit, and as the defacto spirit/demi-god of bomb coin. Destroying all faith in bomb coin throughout the planes. But at the same time finally releasing a dear friend from bondage. As thanks bomb promised to help restore the power lost to [Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) and [Elira](/characters/elira) when they gave up the power gained from the owlbear souls, as bomb fades back into the astral plane.
