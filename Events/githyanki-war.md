# Githyanki War
After two months of preparation, the party gives their response to [Vlaakith's](/characters/vlaakith) demands by beginning an all out assault on [Tu'nareth](/locations/tunarath).

## The Plan
The plan was for [Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) and [Spoops](/characters/spoops) to sneak in the city with whatever quiet teleport anti detection magic they have, while assuming Vlaakith would be able to detect arrivals into her city, then they would have to make contact with the ground and Spoops would be able to raise the dead titan as an undead servant. Spoops would then use the titan to disrupt their military capability and assist in fighting Vlaakith. Then Adalynn opens the floodgates to [Mortis Lux HQ](/locations/mortis-lux-hq), our armies fly through and engage military targets, and the rest of the party goes for Vlakiith while Adalynn and Spoops verify that the phylactery which is Vlaakith's floating castle, is destroyed before joining the rest of the party. This is assuming all goes well, and the party engage Vlakiith at the same time. If there is an issue, then Adalynn and Spoops will get the titan raised and join the fight asap.

## The Battle
After much preparation, the party ordered 220 of their ships to fly into combat. They set off from Mortis Lux HQ, through magic gates directly above Tu'narath. Taking the gith by surprise, they bombarded the enemy airships and bases. While the air raid was ongoing, the party split up to execute their plan. Adalynn, [Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos), and [Elira](/characters/elira) flew towards the castle floating above the city where Vlaakith was attacking at range. Spoops flew below the body of the dead titan, looking for a way below the surface to the rotten flesh of the beast. After a short time Spoops found his entrance to the beasts flesh, where he was able to make contact and cast a 12th level Animate Dead on the titan corpse. As divine magical energy electrified the realm, the titan awoke as an undead servant. Spoops used the titan's 6 arms to wipe away the enemy gith forces, crippling their resistance as Vlaakith watched in horror. 

Spoops proceeded to join the party at Vlaakith's castle for the final confrontation. During the fight with Vlaakith, Spoops and Bazzdos tanked the lich queen while Adalynn prepared her plan. Spoops gloated to Vlaakith, shaming her for mocking his power and telling her to behold the power he wields over lofe and death. He then revealed himself to be the immortal God of Souls, becoming in two months and two days what she aspired to become over millenia. Adalynn struck the final blow, True polymorphing Vlaakith into a tiny statue of herself. Ending the Githyankii queen forever.

## Conclusion

### The Undead Titan
Tu'narath, is now an undead titan corpse controlled by Spoops. Tu'narath is teleported into orbit around [Mardun](/locations/Mardun), becoming a new moon until it is needed again.

### The Ithillids Arrive at Tu'narath 
As the battle ends and [Mortis Lux](/organizations/mortis-lux) is in the process of flying back home through their portals, The Ithillids giant creature arrives. Simply beholding it melts the minds of any still on that side of the portal. Hundreds of Mortis Lux soldiers and Githyanki had their minds obliterated. The surviving Githyanki are offered refuge by the Githzerai and Mortis Lux. Mortis Lux learns how their military strategy, equipment, and training must be improved from their battle against the Githyanki, and discovers the glaring weaknesses they have agaisnt psionics and deific powers after the Ithilid's unexpected appearance.
