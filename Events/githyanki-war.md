# Githyanki War
After two months of preparation, the party gives their response to Vlaakith's demands by beginning an all out assault on Tu'nareth.

## The Battle
After much preparation, the party ordered 220 of their ships to fly into combat. They set off from Mortis Lux HQ, through magic gates directly above Tu'narath. Taking the Gith by surprise, they bombarded the enemy airships and bases. While the air raid was ongoing, the party split up to execute their plan. Adalynn, Bazzdos, and Elira flew towards the castle floating above the city where Vlaakith was attacking at range. Spoops flew below the body of the dead titan, looking for a way below thr surface to the rotten flesh of the beast. After a short time Spoops found his entrance to the beasts flesh, where he was able to make contact and cast a 12th level Animate Dead on the titan corpse. As divine magical energy electrified the realm, the titan awoke as an undead servant. Spoops used the titans 6 arms to wipe away the enemy goth forces, crippling their resistance as Vlaakith watched in horror. 

Spoops proceeded to join the party at Vlaakith's castle for the final confrontation. During the fight with Vlaakith, Spoops and Bazzdos tanked the lich queen while Adalynn prepared her plan. Spoops gloated to Vlaakith, shaming her for mocking his power and telling her to behold the power he wields over lofe and death. He then revealed himself to be the immortal God of Souls, becoming in two months and two days what she aspired to become over millenia. Adalynn struck the final blow, True polymorphing Vlaakith into a tiny statue of herself. Ending the Githyankii queen forever.
