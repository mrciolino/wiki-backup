# Spoops vs. Zeus
While investigating [Assassination Mountain](/locations/library-dimension/assassination-note-mountain), [Bazzdows](/characters/bazzdos) recieves a request from [Zeus](/characters/zeus) for 1v1 combat against [Spoops](/characters/spoops). Thinking this is an opportunity to make some easy money. His overconfidence in Spoops' abilites causes a bit of trouble for Spoops. 

## Zeus vs. Spoops Brought to you by Bazzdos
While Spoops and [Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) were with [Vlaakith](/characters/vlaakith), [Bazzdows](/characters/bazzdos) was investigating Assassination Mountain in the [Library dimension](/locations/Library-Dimension). Bazzdows finds an assassination note from someone seeking combat with Spoops. He proceeds to work with a lawyer in the library to set up a fight between Zeus and Spoops.

## Spoops and Zeus fight 1v1: 
The party travels to a colosseum on [Olympus](/locations/olympus) where an angry Zeus is waiting to fight Spoops. Zeus had been decieved by the [Prophet of Profit](/characters/krorg) into replacing all of Olympus' treasury with Bombcoin, and after Spoops freed [Bomb's](/characters/Bomb-the-Bear) soul, the value of Bombcoin dropped to 0. Unable to locate the Prophet, Zeus decides to take out his frustration on Spoops instead.

[Breezy-E](/characters/breezy) and Bazzdows watch from the stands, drinking from gravy boats of wine. Spoops immediately uses 10 charges of enlarge on himself, dwarfing Zeus in size, but no matter what attacks he makes at Zeus, he cant even scratch him. Zeus also has difficulty damaging Spoops as he is immune to lightning damage and magic, and is forced to settle for physical damage. With all of his normal moves failing, and the rounds counting down until his enlarge spell wears off, Spoops is forced to pull some wacky shenanigans. He tries using world seed to summon a planets worth of dragons to attack Zeus, but Zeus is able to swallow them in a single breath. Spoops then  drinks a [Protein Shake of Power](/items/Protein-Shake-Of-Power) to open a portal into the Far Realms where he exposes Zeus to an outer god. This greatly affects Zeus' mind, and Spoops took the opportunity to use his 12th level spell: [The Banhammer](/Spells/The-Banhammer). However to Spoops' surprise the hammer has no effect on Zeus, and Zeus grabs the hammer and smashes Spoops into the ground, crushing his skull. |Breezy-E attacks Zeus with his bow, but his attacks go beneath his notice. 

Zeus, furious that Spoops possesses Titan weaponry, decides to use his most powerful attack, ***Hyperion Demolition of Supreme Obliteration*** to atomize Spoops so he could never return. Before launching this attack, Zeus tells everyone in the crowd to leave which Bazzdows ignores. The attack entirely obliterates the arena, Breezy-E left when Zeus told him to via a portal, and Bazzdows is shattered and his corpse is blasted into space. Afterwards, Zeus gets intel that the Prophet of Profit has been located on the Illithid Flagship, and departs to go kill him next. Spoops manages to survive this with his boon that lets him take no damage and sneaks away. 

Spoops receives a message from [Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) asking what is going on, he replies "zeus too strong, he thinks us dead, bazz shattered, unsure about resurrection until repaired, seeking hepheastus. breezyE lives, must plan stop zeus, help". In response, Adalynn opens a gate to retrieve them.


## Repairing Bazzdows
Bazzdows was broken and slain during the explosion that he reverted to his ball form. Spoops and Adalynn repair what they can of Bazzdows before Spoops reboots Bazzdows. Adalynn implants the eyes of her dragon form into Bazzdos, allowing her to see what he sees. The supercharged divine lightning from Zeus' attack, fused with his body, supercharging his soul core and triggering an update upon reboot. As his physical form recovered, his operating system updated and he became Bazzdos.

*Adalynn does something with Bazzdos' soul core and her eyes???



## Quest for Power
After being humiliated and slain, Spoops gets desperate for more strength. He puts all his focus on acquiring more power quickly. This leads him to commit his [Second Great Sin](/Events/the-second-great-sin-of-spoops).
