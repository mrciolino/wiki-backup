# Spoops vs. Zeus
While investigating Assassination Mountain, Bazzdows recieves a request from Zeus for 1v1 combat against Spoops. Thinking this is an opportunity to make some easy money. His overconfidence in Spoops' abilites causes a bit of trouble for Spoops. 

## Zeus vs. Spoops Brought to you by Bazzdos
While Spoops and Adalynn were with Vlaakith, Bazzdos was investigating Assassination Mountain in the Library dimension. Bazzdos finds an assassination note from someone seeking combat with Spoops. He proceeds to work with a lawyer in the library to set up a fight between Zeus and Spoops.

## Spoops and Zeus fight 1v1: 
The party travels to a colessium on Olympus where an angry Zeus is waiting to fight Spoops. Zeus had been decieved by the [Prophet of Profit](/characters/krorg) into replacing all of Olympus' treasury with Bombcoin, and after Spoops freed Bomb's soul, the value of Bombcoin dropped to 0. Unable to locate the Prophet, Zeus decides to take out his frustration on Spoops instead.

Breezy-E and Bazzdows watch from the stands, drinking from gravy boats of wine. Spoops immediately uses 10 charges of enlarge on himself, dwarfing Zeus in size, but no matter what attacks he makes at Zeus, he cant even scratch him. Zeus also has difficulty damaging Spoops as he is immune to lightning damage and magic, and is forced to settle for physical damage. He is able to drag Zeus through the far realms by drinking a Protein Shake of Power. This greatly affects Zeus' mind, and Spoops took the opportunity to use his 12th level spell: The Banhammer. However to Spoops' surprise the hammer has no effect on Zeus. Instead Zeus grabs the hammer and smashes Spoops into the ground, killing him. Zeus then entirely obliterates the arena before leaving, Breezy-E manages to survive the explosion, however Bazzdows is shattered. Spoops resurrects and sneaks away. Spoops receives a message from Adalynn asking what is going on, he replies "zeus too strong, he thinks us dead, bazz shattered, unsure about resurrection until repaired, seeking hepheastus. breezyE lives, must plan stop zeus, help". In response, Adalynn opens a gate to retrieve them.


## Repairing Bazzdows
Bazzdows was broken and slain during the explosion that he reverted to his ball form. Spoops and adalynn repair what they can of Bazzdows before Spoops reboots Bazzdows. Adalynn implants the ryes of her dragon form into Bazzdos, allowing her to see what he sees. The supercharged divine lightning from Zeus' attack, fused with his body, supercharging his soul core and triggering an update upon reboot. As his physical form recovered, his operating system updated and he became Bazzdos.

*Adalynn does something with Bazzdos' soul core and her eyes???



## Quest for Power
After being humiliated and slain, Spoops gets desperate for more strength. He puts all his focus on acquiring more power quickly. This leads him to commit his [Second Great Sin](/Events/the-second-great-sin-of-spoops).
