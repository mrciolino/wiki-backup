# Building The Great Port of Wegate
Mortis Lux begins construction of the Great Port of Wegate, and creation of their fleet of spelljammers.

## The Great Port of Wegate and Infinite Undead Army
The party order the Wegatians to begin constructing the Great Port of Wegate whole they gather the materials to create spelljammer warships. To accomplish this, a large force is deployed to the sea south from wegate to establish a site for construction.

Spoops also commands Wegate and his Paladins to scour the surrounding areas for corpses. They begin the process of gathering all corpses within the region, depositing them outside the temple in Wegate where Spoops and his paladins spend time raising them by the thousands for their undead army.


## Spelljammer Gems: Emeralds
Emeralds power a spelljammer's propulsion. The party returns to the vast Emerald they found in a cave system on Ereriad. Here they shatter large pieces of the emerald and bring them through a gate back to the port.


## Spelljammer Gems: Rubies
Rubies power a spelljammer's weapons. Spoops uses his ring of snakes to summon large numbers of snakes with ruby skin, the party slays the snakes and takes their ruby skin back to the port.


## Spelljammer Gems: Sapphires

Sapphires power a spelljammer's defenses.
