# Building The Great Port of Wegate
Mortis Lux begins construction of the Great Port of Wegate, and creation of their fleet of spelljammers.

## The Great Port of Wegate and Infinite Undead Army
The party order the Wegatians to begin constructing the Great Port of Wegate whole they gather the materials to create spelljammer warships. To accomplish this, a large force is deployed to the sea south from wegate to establish a site for construction.

Spoops also commands Wegate and his Paladins to scour the surrounding areas for corpses. They begin the process of gathering all corpses within the region, depositing them outside the temple in Wegate where Spoops and his paladins spend time raising them by the thousands for their undead army.
