# Investigating Reports of Illithids on Mardun
The party hears of an Illithid nest somewhere under the [Frostfell Mountains](/locations/Mardun/frostfell-mountains) on [Mardun](/locations/Mardun). 

## Bane and Breezy
[Bane](/characters/bane) insists on coming along and goes on [Breezy-E's](/characters/breezy) ship. Bane discovers hes the only one of the dead three not to have blessed Breezy-E, much to Spoops' dismay and Breezy-E's excitement he grants his blessing. 

Breezy-E plays dance music over the ships speakers and starts drinking.
While on the ship Breezy-E sends drunk messages to his old vampire girlfriend and to [Frost](/characters/frost), his ice queen dragon girlfriend who never texts back. Then he starts playing beer pong with Bane, [Luther](/characters/luther), and [Lokunai](/characters/lokunai).

After some more games, Breezy-E grumbles to himself: "Witch *hic* King... mother freaking cheater at *hic* flip cup"

## Descent Underground
With Adalynn missing, the party travels to the frostfell mountains via Spelljammer warship. Breezy-E commands a squad of four warships patrolling the surface while [Spoops](/characters/spoops) and [Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos) blast their way through the ground towards the supposed nest, guided by Spoops' [knife leg](/items/peace-was-never-an-option-dagger).

Spoops ends up crashing directly into the tower of a city inhabited by deep gnomes who unbeknownst to him serve [Daurgothoth](/characters/daurgothoth). Bazzdos is far more graceful with his flying and landing using his rocket gauntlets. 


Somehow Adalynn frees herself. She becomes an ice clone or something???

Adalynn flees upwards through the caves through the gnome city.

The party reunite with Adalynn now free from her service to Daaurgothoth.




## Finding The Nest
The party proceeds deep into the underdark where they find an Illithid lair. They move to strike down one of the Illithids there but before they take their life, the Illithid begs for mercy. 

Shocked that unlike the Ithilids rhey have encountered before, the Illithid speaks, they question it. They ask how the Illithid is capable of speech and how it is even alove after Spoops commanded the hive mind to kill themselves. The Illithid explains that their hive is completely separate from the Emperor's hive. They managed to escape and hide from the Itholid hive before they could be dominated. They gonon to explain that they want nothing to do with the Ithilids. 

The party decides not to exterminate this unrelated hive on the condition they leave the people of this world unharmed and do not seek domination over Mardun or its people. The Illithids swear to obey this condition and the party leaves after delivering one final threat "Mortis Lux will be watching".
