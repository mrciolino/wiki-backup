# Investigating Reports of Illithids on Mardun
The party hears of an Illithid nest somewhere under the Frostfell mountains on Mardun. 

## Bane and Breezy
Bane insists on coming along and goes on Breezy's ship. Bane discovers hes the only one of the dead three not to have blessed Breezy-E so much to Spoops' dismay and Breezy-E's excitement he grants his blessing. 


## Descent Underground
With Adalynn missing, the party travels to the frostfell mountains via Spelljammer warship. Breezy commands a squad of four warships patrolling the surface while Spoops and Bazzdos blast their way through the ground towards the supposed nest, guided by Spoops' knife leg.

Spoops ends up crashing directly into the tower of a city inhabited by deep gnomes who unbeknownst to him serve Daurgothoth. Bazz is far more graceful with his flying and landing using his rocket gauntlets. 

They reunite with Adalynn who was bound to service of Daaurgothoth.


## Finding The Nest
The party proceeds deep into the underdark where they find an Illithid lair. They move to strike down one of the Illithids there but before they take their life, the Illithid begs for mercy. 

Shocked that unlike the Ithilids rhey have encountered before, the Illithid speaks, they question it. They ask how the Illithid is capable of speech and how it is even alove after Spoops commanded the hive mind to kill themselves. The Illithid explains that their hive is completely separate from the Emperor's hive. They managed to escape and hide from the Itholid hive before they could be dominated. They gonon to explain that they want nothing to do with the Ithilids. 

The party decides not to exterminate this unrelated hive on the condition they leave the people of this world unharmed and do not seek domination over Mardun or its people. The Illithids swear to obey this condition and the party leaves after delivering one final threat "Mortis Lux will be watching".
