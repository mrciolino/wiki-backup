# Searching The Forbidden Section of The Library
The party returns to the [Infinite Library Dimension](/locations/Library-Dimension) in search of books that can tell them information on [The Emperor](/characters/Emperor) and his current wherabouts. They first ask the [Tree of Knowledge](/characters/Tree-of-Knowledge) where they might find such a book, the tree tells them that this info can be found in the [Forbidden section](/locations/library-dimension/the-forbidden-section) where angels and demons are fighting a war.


## Fighting Their Way In
The party battle various angels and demons all fighting for control of the powerful books contained within the forbidden section of the libary.


## Exploring Deeper Into The Library
As a librarian of the infinite library, [Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) is able to guide the party through the maze of halls and studies that make up the libary.

[Breezy-E](/characters/breezy) after feeling around finds the braile section and starts reading some childrens books.



## The Dark Section
As they proceed deeper into the forbidden section, they enter a wing of the library that is strangely dark. The party splits up to explore the area. 

The party meet [Athin](/characters/athin), a demi-god fighting for dominance of the forbidden section who has also become a librarian. The demi-god Athin impedes the party's expedition as he seeks information for the gods and has standing orders to take [Spoops](/characters/spoops) out. Some of the party battle Athin and slay him, sending him back to the heavens, Breezy-E was not present for this battle. 

Spoops encounters a terrified group of paladins who serve [Bahamut](/characters/bahamut). They are on a holy mission to expel the demons within this section of the library and take control for the [Council of Gods](/organizations/the-council-of-gods), however they ran into a particularly powerful creature that killed some of their men. They immediately recognize Spoops for who he is and prepare for the worst. Spoops has to calm them down as he explains he means them no harm, he tells them that given their weakened state they should stick with him and they would get out of here together. Spoops tells them more about how he really just wants the Gods to quit trying to kill him and as long as they don't try to fight him, Spoops won't either. Eventually They re-group with the rest of the party and encounter the creature that was killing these paladins.


## The Giant Section
The party enters a wing of the library where all of the books and shelves are giant sized. 

Spoops uses his [ring](/items/Ring-Of-Magnificent-Size) to grow so that he would be closer in size to the scale of the shelves and books. The rest of the party ride into the room atop Spoops.

Within this room are demons and worshipers of [Shar](/characters/shar), both riding chariots into battle against each other. The party assist the worshippers of Shar against the demons obliterating them entirely.

The party and Shar worshippers manage to escape to the next room where they thank the party for their help. Spoops then prays to Shar to tell her that he just ran into some of her followers in the library and gave them a hand. After a flirtatious reunion between the two, Shar grants Spoops access to her shadow weave.


## The Illithid
The party encounters an Illithid studying in the library. 


## Proceeding To The Next Section
The party proceed to the final section guided by Adalynn. 

Breezy-E wandered off and was left behind. He enters a new room and encounters Athin. They proceed together to the next section.


## Breezy-E Meets Athin
Breezy-E encounters Athin on his own. Athin tells Breezy-E that he is a librarian.

Breezy-E begins pestering them with tons of questions and requests. He chats up "the big man" about his favorite characters including the hairless hobbit. Breezy-E does not take a breath for more than 5 minutes. Breezy-E asks the librarian what his favorite book is. Breezy-E also asks the librarian what's his favorite color, and why its his favorite color. Once he gets that answer, he asks him what made him become a librarian, and when he became one. Afterwards, he starts humming to his favorite tunes off pitch. He then decides to talk about how more books should be written in braile, and how the library can be more inclusive. Breezy-E starts playing with his hair, swinging his feet back and forth waiting to get to his next book. Breezy-E asks them if he could author a book. Breezy-E regardless of the answer, starts verbally telling the story he wants to tell for his story book.

Breezy-E tells his story to the Librarian while waiting for them to bring him "[dragons vs knights vol 4 big picture edition](/items/dragons-vs-knights-big-picture-edition)": 

"Once upon a time in ancient Japan, there lived a skilled and honorable samurai named Hiroshi. Hiroshi was known throughout the land for his unwavering loyalty, exceptional swordsmanship, and deep sense of justice. He had dedicated his life to serving his lord and protecting the weak. One day, Hiroshi received a cryptic message from an old friend, revealing the existence of a hidden treasure at the top of Mount Hakusan. Intrigued by the prospect of uncovering this secret, Hiroshi embarked on a treacherous journey to the legendary mountain. As Hiroshi ascended the steep slopes, he encountered numerous obstacles. The path was rugged and the weather unforgiving. Yet, the samurai remained determined, pushing forward with every ounce of strength and resilience he possessed. Days turned into weeks as Hiroshi persevered, battling through dense forests, scaling rocky cliffs, and enduring the biting cold. The mountain seemed to test his resolve at every turn, but Hiroshi refused to be deterred. He knew that the treasure at the summit would be worth every hardship he faced. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Hiroshi reached the peak of Mount Hakusan. Gasping for breath, he stood in awe of the breathtaking view that unfolded before him. The mountain range stretched as far as the eye could see, and the golden rays of the setting sun bathed the landscape in a warm, ethereal glow. As Hiroshi caught his breath, he noticed an ancient shrine nestled amidst the rocks. Curiosity ignited within him, and he approached the shrine cautiously. Inside, he discovered a worn and weathered scroll, adorned with intricate calligraphy. With trembling hands, Hiroshi unrolled the scroll and began to read. It spoke of a treasure far greater than gold and jewelsâ€”a treasure that lay within the depths of one's heart. It revealed that true wealth was not measured by material possessions but by the virtues of courage, compassion, and wisdom. Enlightened by the profound message, Hiroshi understood that the journey itself had been the treasure he sought all along. He had endured physical hardship, faced his fears, and discovered the depths of his own character. The true reward was not in the material wealth but in the personal growth he had achieved. Filled with a renewed sense of purpose, Hiroshi descended from the mountain, carrying the scroll with him. He dedicated the rest of his life to embodying the virtues he had discovered, spreading wisdom, compassion, and justice wherever he went. And so, the samurai who had set out to find a treasure on top of a mountain ended up finding an even greater treasure within himself. Hiroshi's legend lived on, inspiring generations to come with the knowledge that true wealth lies not in what we possess, but in who we become."
