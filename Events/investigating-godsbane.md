# Investigating Godsbane
Tired of the blade following them and driving whoever wields it to murder, the party tries various methods to destroy the blade.



## All Attempts Fail
The party tries various methods to destroy Godsbane.

Adalynn tries to dispel magic on the blade but fails.

Spoops tries striking Godsbane with the Shard of Divinity, however it has no effect.

Spoops attempts to destroy Godsbane using his 12th level spell "The Banhammer". However it does not work. He accidentally strikes Adalynn with the Banhammer, causing her to disappear from existence. The party looks in stunned silence unable to stop her from disappearing. All attempts to contact Adalynn via message and speaking stone fail. As the party realizes Adalynn may truly be gone forever, they receive reports of Illithids on Mardun and decide to go take out their frustration on them.
