# Investigating The Cultist's Fortress
After burying Bomb and burning the bodies, the party returns to their mission and investigates the fortress.

## Bazzert Gathers Things Suspiciously
After the funeral you return back to the mission at hand to search for artifacts and weapons belonging to the old Liches of the necrotic wars. Along they way Bazzert finds a cool, looking gem and gathers a bunch of random ingredients that aren't that suspicious for a druid to gather but did so in a suspicious manner.


## Vials of Green Liquid
The party find excavated areas in the fortress and among them, a chest contaminated with a green glowing liquid. They find all the vials within are broken except one half filled vial. 

Drakham and Spoops then conduct some "experiments" on the liquid, combining it with holy water, spit, seeing if it flammable, and taking contaminated dirt and dumping it into a freshly made grave. the green liquid sizzles away from the holy water, just combines with the spit, is very flammable, and does not show any immediate effect on the grave.


## Investigsting The Tower
The team search a tower on the east side of the ruined fortress and find a pentagram symbol and a flayed body stabbed with a demonic dagger. Spoops decides to be cautious and throw a dagger into the body in the pentagram. Then Krorg takes the arcane focuses he got from the cultist wizards and places them at the points in the pentagram star, this causes the body to float and start screaming. Thinking there mist be some way to communicste with the screaming corpse, the party tries to disguise themselves as cultists and stand around the pentagram, but there is no effect. Then they try to break the ritual star, which is not effective. Bazzert then uses the cursed horn and the screaming corpse starts to play demonic music. After a while the team pulls out the daggers from the corpse's chest, and it speaks to them. He is the protector of the poisons in the fortress and tells the team what he can. Then after trying to free his soul or at least learn how to, the party just break the pentagram ritual and start to leave the fortress. 

## The Bone Spider
As they cross the bridge over the river, they are attacked by a giant bone spider coming from their freshly dug grave. In the battle Drakham and Krorg nearly die but Bazzert and Spoops defeat the abomination. Then they depart, returning to Demsford.
