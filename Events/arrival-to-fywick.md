# Arrival to Fywick
The party finally arrives at the city of [Fywick](/locations/Mardun/Fywick). After a tense journey, they've put some distance between them and [Carl](/characters/carl).


## Arriving at Fywick's Docks
The party arrives in Fywick to seek the [Oracles](/characters/oracle-of-fywick) guidance on how to defeat [Darmuth](/characters/Darmuth). Upon arrival to Fywick, the party parks their flying ship above the docks. [Frederina](/characters/Frederina) stays with the ship while [Bazvrah](/characters/Bazvrah), [Meade](/characters/meade), and [Os](/characters/os) seek out Bazzvrah's underground connection [Steveo](/characters/steveo) in a nearby brothel with a big red door. Here they meet the mafia boss [Tony Mozzarella](/characters/Tony-Mozzarella). Steveo is Tony's right hand man/enforcer. After hanging out for some time, they leave to meet up with [Spoops](/characters/spoops) and [Narascus](/characters/Narascus) at the Oracle's temple.

## Heading to The Oracle's Temple
Spoops and Narascus are more interested in doing some shopping so they briefly explore the city before walking up to the Oracle's temple in the center of town. Once outside the temple, they meet up with the rest of the part except for Frederina, before heading in to meet the Oracle.
