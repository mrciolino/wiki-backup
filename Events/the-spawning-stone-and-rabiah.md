# The Spawning Stone and Rabiah
The party resolve to enhance the imprisonment of [Kronos](/characters/kronos) after realizing how unreliable the gods are, and how weak the chains of [Carseri](/locations/carseri) may be. They decide to seek out reagents to cast imprisonment on Kronos once again.


## The Elemental Plane of Chaos
After seeing the kind of raw materials that exist in the [elemental plane of chaos](/locations/elemental-plane-of-chaos) after accidentally traveling there through a window in the [library dimension](/locations/library-dimension/forbidden-section), [Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos) leads the party on an expedition there to find a titanic gemstone to be used for the Imprisonment spell. The party wants to find such a gem in order to cast imprisonment once again on Kronos in order to improve the security of Carceri.


## The Spawning Stone
Upon arrival, the party encounters a storm of matter and energy spitting out an ever growing pillar of mithril. As they approach, they are confronted by giant golems which attempt to capture them. During the chaos, [Spoops](/characters/spoops) ascends the tower they came from and finds a way in.


## Spoops Meets Rabiah
Spoops meets [Rabiah](/characters/rabiah) the storm giant woman in her tower at the [spawning stone](/locations/elemental-plane-of-chaos/spawning-stone) in the elemental plane of chaos. Upon finding himself in this plane, he ascends the tower and finds two golems guarding a control panel. Spoops cautiously approaches and activates the panel, causing the platform to begin descending into the tower. Upon reaching the bottom, he is greeted by [Rabiah's butler](/characters/rabiahs-butler) and Rabiah herself. Rabiah welcomes Spoops into her home and introduces herself as a forge-master and merchant. She also introduces her dinner guest [Raphael](/characters/raphael), a powerful devil who attempts to make a deal with Spoops but is quickly shot down. She has set up shop around an infinitely generating pillar of mithril which she uses to build her magical golems. She tells Spoops that she owns this spawning stone and needs it for production of her golems. Spoops apologizes for the intrusion. Spoops begins trying to recruit her into [Mortis Lux](/organizations/mortis-lux), but she refuses. Instead she offers to sell golems to Mortis Lux, and provides a "method of secure communication" to Spoops in case he wishes to discuss this further. This communicator is what appears to be a humanoid creature, heavily bound and chained, Rabiah is able to speak through the mouth of this creature. Spoops puts the creature in his demi-plane and leaves. As he departs, the butler takes a look at his [Shard of Divinity](/items/shard-of-divinity) and comments on the single flaw in the hilt. Saying it would have to be remade to fix it entirely. Spoops takes this under consideration.


## The Party Leaves in Peace
The party arrives at the spawning stone to retrieve Spoops. Spoops tells them that the spawning stone is owned by Rabiah and in the interest of doing further business with her down the line, the party should give up on this particular stone. They party agree and depart.
