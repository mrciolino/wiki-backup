# Entertaining Bandits
The party runs into bandits on their way to Trelston.


## Traveling With The Caravan
After speaking eith a ghostly pickle in Fort Suro, the party departs in the morning with the caravan. However, they run into highwaymen who demsnd a toll, but instead of fighting them, the party try to pay the toll by entertaining the bandit leader named Balk and his crew of ne'er-do-wells. Not only do they succeed, but Otto and Drakham steal 250 Gold and 5 Grenades, and Balk enjoys the performance so much that he gives a standing ovation and allows the party and caravan to go unmolested.
