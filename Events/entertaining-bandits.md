# Entertaining Bandits
The party runs into bandits on their way to [Trelston](/locations/Mardun/Trelston).


## Traveling With The Caravan
After speaking with a ghostly pickle named [Pickle Rick](/characters/pickle-rick) in Fort Suro, the party departs in the morning with the caravan. However, they run into highwaymen who demand a toll, but instead of fighting them, the party try to pay the toll by entertaining the bandit leader named [Balk](/characters/balk) and his crew of ne'er-do-wells. Not only do they succeed, but [Otto](/characters/Otto-Hurtszog) and [Drakham](/characters/drakham) steal 250 Gold and 5 Grenades, and Balk enjoys the performance so much that he gives a standing ovation and allows the party and caravan to go unmolested.
