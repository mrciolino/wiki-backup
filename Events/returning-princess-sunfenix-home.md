# Returning Princess Sunfenix Home
The party finally returns the [princess](/characters/vilra-sunfenix) home to her [father](/characters/king-sunfenix) in [Hellaress](/locations/Ereriad/Hellaress).


## Returning The Princes
After returning from the Feywild with the princess, the party meets with the king and tells him of the death of the [Witch King](/characters/bane), and return of the princess. The King is overjoyed, however his attention is quickly drawn to the Witch King's ring in [Bazzdows'](/characters/bazzdos) bag. He demands to see the ring. Threatening to execute the party if they refuse. The ring's dark influence was feeding his desire to put it on. Bazzdows complies and hands the ring to King Sunfenix. When the king puts on the ring, Bane takes over his body.

## Adalynn Receives 10th Level Spells
[Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) is put into stasis while her mind meets with the Witch King. As a reward for bringing him back, Bane grants Adalynn her choice of 10th level spells from his collection. Bane grants her the [Blade of Cataclysm](/spells/Blade-Of-Cataclysm), [Ushorans Catastrophe](/spells/Ushorans-Catastrophe), and [Moving Mountains](/Spells/Moving-Mountains) spells.

Bane reveals that he has taken full control over King Sunfenix's body and gloats that he rules Hellaress.

The party, knowing this would happen are not surprised, but saddened that they let the princess down and had no choice but to either fight the King, risking everyone's lives, or allow Bane to take over his body, at least allowing him to live on for now.

## Spoops and Wegate Begin Raising Their Undead Army
The party rest in the castle for the night. The next morning, Spoops tells Bazzdows not to tell Bane that he had woken up yet. Spoops teleports to the [library dimension](/locations/Library-Dimension) where he asks [Bazzalt](/characters/Bazzalt) to teleport him to [Wegate](/locations/Mardun/Wegate). Once in Wegate Spoops and his paladins begin raising wights for his army.
