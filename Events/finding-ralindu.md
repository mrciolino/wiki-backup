# Finding Ralindu
After departing from Fywick, the party takes a detour in which they seek out a giant ruby they learned about in a vision they received from a card pulled from the deck of many things.


## Locating The Ruby and A Lich
The party seeks out a giant ruby they saw in a vision after pulling a card from the deck of many things. Using Dio, they find the location of the ruby to be on a mountainside in the Celestial Vale to the west of Fywick. They find Ralindu Kosimostrovu Phorumdi the lich sealed inside the Ruby. Upon releasing him, he provides guidance to the party and accompanies them on the flying ship.
