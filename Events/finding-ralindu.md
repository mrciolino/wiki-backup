# Finding Ralindu
After departing from [Fywick](/locations/Mardun/Fywick), the party takes a detour in which they seek out a giant ruby they learned about in a vision they received from a card pulled from the [deck of many things](/items/Deck_Of_Many_Things).


## Locating The Ruby and A Lich
The [Low Bar Brawlers](/organizations/low-bar-brawlers) received a vision from a card of the [Deck of Many Things](/items/Deck_Of_Many_Things) of a massive ruby. After the [Battle of Fywick](/Events/the-battle-of-fywick) they used [Dio](/items/dio) to locate the ruby. They flew to its location in the [Celestial Vale](/locations/Mardun/celestial-vale) west of Fywick. Upon finding it, they noticed a humanoid shape trapped within. [Spoops](/characters/spoops) then used [Earth Terror](/items/Earth-Terror) to shatter the ruby, freeing Ralindu.

Ralindu then introduced himself as the Lich Lord Ralindu Kosimostrovu Phorumdi. Upon releasing him, he provides guidance to the party and accompanies them on the flying ship.
