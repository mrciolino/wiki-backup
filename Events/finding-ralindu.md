# Finding Ralindu
After departing from [Fywick](/locations/Mardun/Fywick), the party takes a detour in which they seek out a giant ruby they learned about in a vision they received from a card pulled from the [deck of many things](/items/Deck_Of_Many_Things).


## Locating The Ruby and A Lich
The party seeks out a giant ruby they saw in a vision after pulling a card from the deck of many things. Using [Dio](/items/dio), they find the location of the ruby to be on a mountainside in the [Celestial Vale](/locations/Mardun/celestial-vale) to the west of [Fywick](/locations/Mardun/Fywick). They find [Ralindu Kosimostrovu Phorumdi](/characters/ralindu) the lich sealed inside the Ruby. Upon releasing him, he provides guidance to the party and accompanies them on the flying ship.
