# Meeting Obox-ob
The party is captured by a powerful demon after only speaking his name.


## Reading The Name
After reading a name (Obox-ob), they found on an item in Vlaakith's treasury, the party were all forcibly dragged into the Abyss by the ancient demon Obox-ob himself.


## Dinner Party in The Abyss
They find themselves in a dining room with a few others, namely the Witch King Bane, and another individual dressed in green who introduces themselves as the Norse God Loki.

Obox-ob welcomes the party to his home and expresses a wish to become allys. He makes offers of power to thr party in exchange for a pact with him. The party attempt to politely refuse, wanting nothing to do with a creature as immensely powerful and evil as Obox-ob.

However, Obox-ob is persistent.


## The Wedding of Kierkegaard and Vilra Sunfenix
During the dinner party in Obox-ob's domain in the Abyss. Obox-ob demanded a wedding be performed and insinuated that without one nobody would leave his domain without a fight. Bane offered up the daughter of his host body, King Sunfenix. Spoops called upon Kierkegaard and asked him if he would be willing to marry the princess. Kierkegaard agreed and they were promptly wed. 

However, Obox-ob cursed their union, making it so that one day their lineage would produce a demonic child. In response Spoops blessed their union, granting their bloodline immortality and youthfulness. They and their direct descendants would be granted immortality so long as they wished. If one of their descendants chose to die naturally this would be allowed. Spoops made Kierkegaard and the princess aware of the demonic curse and the influence Obox-ob could have over such a child, he ordered them to watch their bloodline closely to watch out for auch a child.


## Attempting to Escape
The whole time they are in Obox-ob's domain, the party has been quietly trying various methods to escape. Adalynn has made attempts to teleport, gate, cast attack spells, etc. but her spells fail each time. Spoops has also been trying to pray to other gods, reach his followers through religious channels, etc. but finds all attempts fail. Bazzdos has also attempted to use his speaking stone network but with no success. Eventually Obox-ob drops the facade, revealing his dining room and humanoid form to be an illusion. His true form is a maddening twisted demon and rhe environment reflects the same horror.


## Fleeing To The Library
The party try to escspe Obox-Ob's lair in the abyss. While Obox-ob is trying to convince the party to accept his "blessings", Spoops and Adalynn are working on a way out of his realm.

They try escaping through the windows of the dining room, however they find the rest if the realm to be a barren wasteland.

Adalynn tried to gate out of the realm, but is unable to cast any meaningful spells. Spoops realizes the entire layer of the Abyss is like Obox-ob's divine realm. 

Spoops manages to activate his anti-magic armor and use his spell to teleport to the library dimension, escsping Obox-ob's grasp. However the rest of the party, kierkegaard, and his now wife are still trapped. Now that he is free, he is able to execute a plan to get the others out. 

As Spoops escapes, knowing he must have something up his sleeve and won't abandon them, Adalynn carefully works to get the rest of the party and their friends close together. However despite her efforts she is unable to do so before everyone is convinced to accept Obox-ob's "blessings". In the end, even Adalynn accepted. 

Once he was in the library, Spoops used his ability to lend his anti-magic armor to Adalynn, causing it to immediatly envelop her, allowing her to activate it and plane shift everyone to the library.


## The Plan To Kill Obox-ob
The party then traded information with the Tree of Knowledge to obtain a book containing information on exactly how to defeat and kill Obox-ob, they hid the book beneath the tree and the Tree of Knowledge made a pledge to only divulge this information in thr future if requested by a member of Mortis Lux.
