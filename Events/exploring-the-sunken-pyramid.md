# Exploring The Sunken Pyramid
The party went underwater with [Nut's](/characters/bane) caravan and encountered an [underwater pyramid](/locations/Ereriad/sunken-pyramid. They explored the pyramid and discover the truth about Nut.


## Going Under The Ocean
The party proceeded with Nut's caravan and continued their journey under the ocean. Nut's carriage showed that it had submersible capabilities. 

While under the water, [Crocgar](/characters/crocgar) taught [Os](/characters/os) some interesting vocal tricks. 


## The Underwater Pyramid
The party found an underwater pyramind complex which they chose to explore. Nut stayed with the carriage, claiming to not have the ability to breath underwater. 

Within the pyramid they found the spawn of [Glub Glub The Immortal](/characters/glub-glub), which were giant black crabs with a near impenetrable carapace whom they defeated. 

## The Cursed Weapon Hoard
The party found a hoard of cursed weapons. While investigating the weapons, Nut suddenly appeared behind them. Nut dropped his act, revealing a far more intimidating persona. He took off his disguise and revealed himself to be the Witch King. 

He offered a deal to the party to work with him to save the world. He claimed to share a goal with the party of slaying the devastation creatures and other threats to the world. After much back and forth, the party agreed with him, believing they could perhaps have a common goal, especially when it came to dealing with extra-planar threats like [Darmuth's master](/characters/emperor).

Suddenly the demons who owned the hoard appeared. The demons were multitude of demon geese. The party fought them off, killing them. 

The witch king cast a spell to remove the curses on the weapons, and allowed the party to claim a few.
