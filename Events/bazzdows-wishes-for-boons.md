Bazzdows makes a wish: "I wish for the party to recieve boons up to lvl 6th boon inclusive. Party members will recieve lvl 1 and 3 boons as well if they dont already have them. They will recieve this wish without reprieve or consquences besides the benefit of such boon selection. All party members will have thier choice of boon (1,3,6) to take at a time of their choosing without extenral factors effecting their decesion. The boons selected will have instanous effect to their desired strength without the possible negative - time or character based effects."


## The Marut Arrive
A team of Marut appear and attempt to forcibly take Spoops. The wish Bazzdows made rings in Spoops' head and offers spoops the power of an epic boon if he kills all the marut himself. He fails to kill all of them himself as he requires help from the party. Spoops has to get away by teleporting to the library dimension while the party lure the Marut away. Elira tells Spoops via speaking stone that the Marut have been led away, and the party will begin to rally their forces and tells Spoops to stay safe.
