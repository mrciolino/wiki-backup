# Arrival To Hellaress
The party traveled with a caravan led by a merchant named [Nut](/characters/bane) to the closest major city: [Hellaress](/locations/Ereriad/Hellaress).


## Pranking Spoops
During the journey, one of the party members stole [Spoops'](/characters/spoops) dick (the immovable rod) to play a prank on him, hurting his feelings. In response, upon arrival to the city, Spoops sulked by the river, passively summoning snakes because "they are his only real friends who wont hurt him". He was saying things like this to the snakes using his [ring of animal communication](/items/Ring-Of-Animal-Communication) which made the snakes feel very awkward. Eventually a guard came by and asked if he was doing alright and eventually escorted him to the castle where he met the rest of the party. After a touching moment, they returned his immovable rod and made up.


## An Audience With King Sunfenix
The party received an audience with the king due to having slain the Devastation Shark Scorpion.

The king told them that there are 5 more devastation vermin terrorizing the world. He asked the party to slay the remaining devastation vermin like they did with the first one as they are clearly a capable bunch. The party accepts this quest. 

He also told the party that his daughter was kidnapped by the [Witch King](/characters/bane) and he asked the party to get her back. He informed the party of where to find the [Witch King's castle](/locations/Ereriad/witch-kings-castle), and tells them that he is an evil tyrant who must be stopped.

He told the party about one of the devastation vermin in the south of the kingdom which was a giant beetle. 

He gave the party some items and money and then the party went shopping for some supplies before once again heading out with Nut's caravan.
