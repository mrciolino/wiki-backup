# Arrival To Hellaress
The party travels with a caravan led by a merchant named Nut to the closest major city: Hellaress.


## Pranking Spoops
On the journey one of the party members stole Spoops' dick (the immovable rod) to play a prank on him, hurting his feelings. In response upon arrival to the city, Spoops sulked by the river, passively summoning snakes because "they are his only real friends who wont hurt him". He was saying things like this to the snakes using his ring of animal communication which made the snakes feel very awkward. Eventually a guard came by and asked if he was doing alright and eventually escorted him to the castle where he met the rest of the party. After a touching moment, they returned his immovable rod and made up.


## An Audience With King Sunfenix
The party gets an audience with the king due to them slaying the Devastation Shark Scorpion.

The king tells them that there are 5 more devastation vermin terrorizing the world. He asks the party to slay the remaining devastation vermin like they did with the first one as they are clearly a capable bunch. The party accepts this quest. 

He also tells the party that his daughter was kidnapped by the Witch King and he asks the party to get her back. He informs the party of where to find the Witch King's castle, and tells them that he is an evil tyrant who must be stopped.

He tells the party about one of the devastation vermin in the south of the kingdom which is a giant beetle. 

He gave the party some items and money and then the party goes shopping for some supplies before once again heading out with Nut's caravan.
