# The Infinite Library Dimension
The party is transported to the [infinite library dimension](/locations/library-dimension). The party visits the Library dimension for the first time. 


## Bazzvrah Takes Notes
[Bazvrah](/characters/Bazvrah) takes notice of roots extending throughout the library. As the party slowly make their way through the chaoic maze of the library, he wonders if he might be able to use tree stride to travel throughout the dimension more easily.


## Browsing For Books
[Spoops](/characters/spoops) finds a [book on fighting angels demons and gods](/items/Book-On-Fighting-Angels-Demons-And-Gods).

[Achilles](/characters/Achilles) finds his own [autobiograpy](/items/achilles-autobiography), which to the rest of the party is clearly filled with lies about various great deeds Achilles claims he did. It also says that he dies which scares him.

The party finds [assassination note mountain](/locations/library-dimension/assassination-note-mountain) in the library dimension.


## The Tree of Knowledge
The party meets the [Tree of Knowledge](/characters/Tree-of-Knowledge). [Bazvrah](/characters/Bazvrah) hires [Mort](/characters/mort) to assassinate the tree for 1 gold, but after the tree slaps Mort down, Bazvrah asks for his gold back and Mort cancels the contract.

The tree has two guardians, [Jigglypuff](/characters/jigglypuff) and [Starfox](/characters/starfox).

The tree then speaks to the party saying that it can hear them and it seeks new tomes and knowledge for the library. The tree says that it will accept a tribute of knowledge, and will even trade information if the provided knowledge is worth it.  It will only trade if the knowledge it receives is new, and it only trade its own knowledge for information it deems of equivalent or greater value than the knowledge the party seeks.

[Spoops](/characters/spoops) offers information on how he was able to resurrect himself from the dead. The tree accepts this information and Starfox shows Spoops a new trick, [Soul Steal](/spells/soul-steal). They demonstrate by pulling Spoops' soul out and putting it back in his body. Spoops then does the same.

[Narascus](/characters/Narascus) offers to trade his [Narascene Bible](/items/narascene-bible) in exchange for information on [Darmuth](/characters/Darmuth), in exhange the tree says this "THE NARASCUS BIBLE IS A TRADE I'M WILLING TO ACCEPT FOR ANOTHER PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE, SHE IS A LICH OF THE HIGHEST ORDER AND A MASTER OF MAGIC, SHE HAS MANY A MINION OF LYCANTHROPIC NATURE AND SHE BECOMES PREOCCUPIED ON FULL MOONS BY SPIRITUAL PRACTICES, SHE EXCHANGES ALL HER MAGICAL MIGHT PER FULL MOON TO CONTACT HER EXTERTERESTIAL GOD, IF YOU WISH FOR MORE I WOULD REQUIRE MORE NEW INFORMATION FOR THE TRADE OF KNOWLEDGE"

Narascus asks how he knows this information, the tree responds: "I HAVE THIS INFORMATION IN THE FORM OF HER DIARY. I HAVE ACCESS TO THE WRITTEN POWER WITHIN MY LIBRARY"

The party offers to trade information on [bomb the bear](/characters/Bomb-the-Bear) for information on [Darmuth's phylactery](/items/darmuths-phylactery). The tree responds: "BOMB THE BEAR! I HAVE VERY FEW SOURCES ON THIS CHARACTER. HER PHALACTORY IS HIDDEN AND SHE DOESN'T DESCRIBE IT IN HER DIARY, ONLY MAKING REFERENCES TO SOMETHING IN HASTOW OF GREAT IMPORTANCE... [ITHILID](/characters/emperor)? ITHILID IS A PATRON OF MY KNOWLEDGE, HE IS THE EMPEROR OF THE ILLITHIDS. THE CUREENT RULER OF THE [ILINOR IMPERIUM](/organizatioms/the-ilinor-imperium)"

Narascus then shows the tree what having sight is like by placing his robe of eyes on its branch. The tree is overwhelmed by this new ability and makes the party an offer: "I WILL TRADE IT FOR FREE PASSAGE AGAINST MY LIBRARIANS. THE LIBRARIANS WILL AID YOU IN THEIR CAPACITY. IF YOU WISH TO BRING ME MORE KNOWLEDGE I WILL BE A POWERFUL ALLY. FOR THE FUTURE. A CONTINUING RELATIONSHIP"


## Bazzvrah Becomes The Tree of Knowledge
Bazvrah asked the tree how to read the rest of his [book on killing gods](/items/How-To-Kill-Gods) and the tree responded: "I THINK YOU NEED THE ABILITY TO READ THE OLD TONGUES. ENTER MY BODY AND BEOME ONE WITH ME AND THE KNOWLEDGE"

Bazvrah then casts tree stride and becomes one with the tree of knowledge. Grandpa Mort shouts out "Grandson No!!!" as he gently stabs the tree in defeat. 

Bazvrah tells the party to find his brother [Bazzalt](/characters/Bazzalt), the 3ft. tall frog druid.

The party say their goodbyes to Bazvrah as he is now the tree of knowledge. The party leaves the library, returning to [Mardun](/locations/Mardun).
