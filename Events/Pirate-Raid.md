## Prelude to the Raid
The party is at a low point with [Bomb](/characters/Bomb-the-Bear) and [Illiard](/characters/illiard) dead, [Allford](/locations/Mardun/Allford) destroyed, and no way to track down [Rathwing](/characters/Rathwing). The party sails off to [Saragassa](/locations/Mardun/Saragassa) in a search of something to do, and end up in a pirate tavern called The Whore's Nipple. In a moment of madness, perhaps inspired by the latent soul of Garl Glittergold, [Krorg](/characters/krorg) realizes that there's a ton of treasure in the vaults of Allford just sitting around waiting for someone to take it. He begins spreading rumors that the Pirate King is going to make a major announcement tomorrow, which many pirates gain interest in. The next day, the Pirate King woke up and heard he was supposed to give a major annoucement but had no idea what was going on, and that is when Krorg approached him with the plan.

## The Plan
1. The entire Saragassa fleet, with ever Pirate Lord, sails to Allford.
2. All battleships bombard the shit out of the ruins of the city to take out as many bone spiders as possible.
3. Three teams are dispatched to targetted areas to loot, Illiard's Tower, the marketplace, and the main target: The Allford castle vaults. 
4. All treasure is brought back to the ships and returned to Saragassa.
5. (Secret) Bazzert stays in Saragassa and assassinates the Pirate King, Krorg uses the momentum from the raid to become the new Pirate King.

But as the party would learn, no plan goes completely correct. There were a great number of surprises and difficulties that lead our heroes to near defeat, but with quick thinking and adaptability they prevailed.

## The Raid
The plan to raid Allford was announced to great excitement, as the promise of the greatest loot of all time was all the pirates could think of. Right before the sendoff, Krorg approached Bazzert and slipped him the secret of the plan, that in the end a new Pirate King would be appointed and it would be to the party's advantage. Bazzert agreed to stay behind, and took a close role to guard the Pirate King.

Os and Frederina were tasked to assist the pirates in taking the marketplace to be looted, while Spoops, Narascus, and Breezy-E were tasked with taking the castle. Krorg would stay behind to maintain a leadership role. Each team was given a smoke bomb to signal when the area was clear of bone spiders and the recovery teams could move in and steal everything. The treacherous [Dave Bones](/characters/Dave-Bones) insisted on accompanying the party into the castle. 

The fleet arrived in the Allford waterfront and began bombing the crap out of the smouldering ruins. After no movement was seen, the first raiding parties moved in, clearing out remaining bone spiders.

Meanwhile back in [Saragassa](/locations/Mardun/Saragassa), the evil [Rathwing](/characters/Rathwing) teleported to an ancient ruin on the island with bone spiders of his own and overran the pirate capital. [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) and the pirate king were forced to flee on a boat and sailed for "safety" towards [Allford](/locations/Mardun/Allford).

Os and Frederina successfully cleared out the market and set off their smoke signal, then went up to the castle to assist the other team. In Illiard's Tower, [Freedom](/characters/freedom), who had been in [Allford](/locations/Mardun/Allford) while it was being destroyed, recognized the situation and decided to go find his old party at the castle. In the castle, the tension was thick as [Spoops](/characters/spoops), [Narascus](/characters/Narascus), and [Breezy-E](/characters/breezy) hated working alongside [Dave Bones](/characters/Dave-Bones) and his crew. However once [Freedom](/characters/freedom) showed up, things really went off. [Dave Bones](/characters/Dave-Bones) sought to steal Freedom's soul again and attacked the party's ally, causing Spoops, Narascus, and Breezy-E to "kill him" as Freedom run away deeper into the castle. Dave Bone's crew, who also didn't like working with Dave Bones, let this offense slide (they also didn't want to be killed by the party). Down two powerful members, the remaining party struggles against the bone spiders. They then decide to let off their smoke signal way too early to call for reinforcements, [Krorg](/characters/krorg) realizes something is off and decides to head up to the castle too. With all forces closing in on the castle, things started going very off even without knowing that they no longer had a place to bring the treasure to.

## Inside the Vault
[Breezy-E](/characters/breezy) starts using some wishes, and somehow this leads to [Dave Bones](/characters/Dave-Bones) returning (he does that a lot). The multiple different groups are stuck wandering the maze-like castle searching for the vault, all while fighting off bone spiders and being hunted by a vengeful [Dave Bones](/characters/Dave-Bones). Eventually everyone makes it to the vault and inside it's full of treasure, but also a zombie beholder, and [Dave Bones](/characters/Dave-Bones) makes his ambush here. The party fights, but these combined threats seem too much to bear and Breezy-E makes his fateful wish that "the two strongest people he knew were here". This causes [Freedom](/characters/freedom) and [Rathwing](/characters/Rathwing) to be teleported inside the vault. Rathwing, who had no idea how he got there but knows the party, and decides he's going to kill them all. However, he gets blinded by Freedom, taking away his ability to misty step, and Breezy-E shoots Rathwing in the eye with an arrow, killing the evil sorcerer. Before he dies, he name drops [Darmuth](/characters/Darmuth), and nobody knows who he's talking about. Krorg kills the zombified beholder and Spoops slays Dave Bones once more. The party starts gathering all of the treasure in the vault, until Frederina for some reason brings up the fact that she killed [Illiard](/characters/illiard) and Freedom overhears this. Krorg, who had lost [Bomb](/characters/Bomb-the-Bear) in his quest for revenge, tells Freedom not to continue this cycle of violence but Freedom isn't having it and decides to fight Frederina. Frederina's evil lobster deity senses this danger and comes into to give her a massive power up. The party evacuates the vault as these two fight. Outside the vault, Krorg stations 20 pirates armed with crossbows to shoot at "the second person who comes through that door". Fun fact, [Knott Em'Portent](/characters/knott-emportent) was one of these ambushers but he isn't relevant again for a while. Frederina escapes the vault with Freedom in pursuit, and as the second person to leave he gets shot dead by the pirates. Frederina's powers leave her and she falls to 0 hp by Krorg's feet. Krorg has the option to kill this obviously evil person but feels bad enough about the death of Freedom and so spares her life. All of the gold is taken to the ships and the  fleet departs from Allford back to Saragassa.

## Return Journey
On the way back, it is revealed to the party through divine communication that [Saragassa](/locations/Mardun/Saragassa) has been destroyed by [Rathwing](/characters/Rathwing) and that [Bazzert](/characters/bazzert) still hasn't killed the pirate king. The party pleas to [Ry-ann] to smack some sense into Bazzert, which he does. Bazzert then kills the pirate king and throws his body into the ocean where it gets eaten by a dragon turtle. The pirate fleet arrives back to find that Saragassa has also been destroyed by bone spiders, and the pirate king is nowhere to be found. An emergency accord is called on the command ship and the pirate lords need to decide on what to do next. As Krorg submits his bid to become the new pirate king, Dave Bones attempts to board but is silently subdued by Spoops and Narascus. The pirates put to vote and elect Krorg the new pirate king on his merits as the raid leader. As his first course of action, Krorg has the entire fleet sail back to Allford where they will form a new pirate capital combining the names of Allford and Saragassa, knows as ALTRICIA. 

## The End
It is up to Krorg as pirate king to divide the spoils of the raid in a fair way among the surviving participants. Allford nobles show up and start demanding their money back and Krorg wonders how they even got here. Regardless, each member of the party is given a total of around 128,000 gold each, the pirate lords are paid, the allford nobles have some of their gold returned, and Krorg forgoes his share of the treasure in exchange for a controlling share of the massive 2 million gold fund to rebuild Altricia into a respectable city state once again. Frederina is given the title of pirate captain, a ship, and a crew, and a letter of marque by Krorg to go find the furthest ocean from Allford. 

On the night of celebration, the party breaks out the Deck of Many Things, and decides to start pulling cards in their less than sober state. Bazzert pulls the card of ruin, and Krorg informs him that his Pirate accountants made a mistake, and his share of 128,000 gold was left unaccounted for. Angered, Bazzert pulls another card to try and win his money back, but pulls a bad card and gets put into a coma. Os pulls the traitor card, and runs from his friends in Altricia. When Krorg hears the news about Os and Bazzert, he concludes Os must have stolen Bazzert's soul. He then takes Os's share of the treasure and puts a bounty on his head, making him the most wanted man in the world. By sunrise, the members of the party depart each to go their own way for the next few years as a means to use their new treasure.
