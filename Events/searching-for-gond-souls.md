# Searching For Gond Souls
The party sets out to [Fywick](/locations/Mardun/Fywick) to collect as many fragments of [Gond's](/characters/Gond) soul from as many gnomes as they can gather.


## Fywick's Gond Convention
The party went looking for Gond, assuming he had been reborn at some point as a Gnome named Gond. The party hired the [Adventurer's guild](/organizations/Adventurer's-Guild) of Fywick to organize an event within Fywick where many gnomes named gond would be gathered. The Adventurer's guild set to work and had a great turnout.

The party snuck into the event and began talking to the gnomes to confirm their names. All of them were indeed named Gond. They further inspected their souls by having [Spoops](/characters/spoops) discreetly soul steal a few gnomes and examine them. After inspection they found that no single gnome was the true Gond. Instead all of the gnomes named Gond had a fragment of Gond’s soul within their own. The party immediately concocted a plan. Spoops and [Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos) would go to the dungeons of [Mortis Lux HQ](/locations/mortis-lux-hq) and [Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) and [Breezy-E](/characters/breezy) would gather and Gate the Gonds to them. Spoops and Bazzdos would perform [Soul Surgery](/spells/soul-surgery) on each Gond, removing the divine portion of their soul and patching them up to the best of their ability. 

## Implanting Gond's Soul Within Bazzdos
As the party began gathering the fragments, they realized that they wouldn't have enough fragments to complete Gond's soul. They would need somewhere to store the soul in the meantime. To resolve this, Spoops and Bazzdos came up with the plan to attach the assembled Gond soul to Bazzdos’ own soul. Allowing Bazzdos and Gond to share the divine power and Gond’s consciousness to slowly heal as more pieces were added. Spoops partitioned their Souls so that while the divine power would be shared, Gond and Bazzdos‘ consciousness would remain separate.  Spoops stitched this mass of Gond souls together and implanted it as a partition within Bazzdos’ soul, empowering him and repairing Gond. 


## Sending the Gonds to Krorg's Hometown
The Gonds were in a state of confusion, much of their memory was gone and they had very little sense of self. They were given instructions to go to [Krorg’s Hometown](/locations/Mardun/north_geskoworm). The party returned to their HQ.
