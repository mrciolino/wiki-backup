# Vlaakith's Offer
Spoops and Adalynn attempt to broker an alliance with Vlaakith, however negotiations go south when Vlaakith demands they bow to her instead.


## Vlaakith Demands Subserviance
Spoops and Adalynn are brought before Vlaakith while looking for allies to join Mortis Lux. Vlaakith makes a counter offer, she will help fight Illithids if Mortis Lux serves her. Upon Spoops and Adalynn's refusal, Vlaakith tries to subjugate them but they are able to resist via anti-magic armor. Spoops attempts to display his power to Vlaakith by casting raise dead at 10th level on the enirety of Tu'narath (the six armed dead titan corpse on which Vlaakith's city is built) he spell fails and Vlaakith laughs at Spoops' "paltry" power. Spoops takes offense and swears revenge. They use the anti-magic armor and teleport away before Vlaakith can hold them captive any longer.

Vlaakith gives the party a warning to reconsider her offer.
