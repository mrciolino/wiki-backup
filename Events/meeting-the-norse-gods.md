Odin tells them that he and his two sons will manifest their avatars to directly assist in the fight. Also he commits his ravens and shadows to assist in the fight as well.

To this, Odin tells him of how he led many of the battles against the Titans, becoming and expert in killing them. Spoops tells Odin of his control over Tu'narath and his responsibility to defeat iaeptus once this war is finished. Odin offers to train Mortis Lux in slaying Titans once the Ithilids are defeated.
