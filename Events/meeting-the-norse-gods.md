# Meeting The Norse Gods
The party go to [Valhalla](/locations/valhalla) to meet the Norse Gods to prepare for the Ithillid War.


## Arrival in Valhalla
The party arrive in Valhalla via gate where they are greeted by [Odin](/characters/odin), head of the Norse pantheon. Odin welcomes them to Valhalla, and guides the party to his great mead hall to discuss battle plans. 


## Meeting The Norse Gods
After the party arrives, Odin introduces his sons [Thor](/characters/thor) and [Loki](/characters/loki). They both greet the party and Loki, having met the party before, greets them with a wink but does seem a bit more serious than the last time they met. 


## Divine Assistance
The party present their battle plan to the Norse Gods and ask what assistsnce they will be providing, as they were assured by the council that there would be direct divine intervention. Odin tells them that he and his two sons will manifest their avatars to directly assist in the fight. Also he commits his ravens and shadows to assist in the fight as well. Odin hands Spoops a [horn](/items/divine-horn-of-valhalla) and instructs him to blow it when [Mortis Lux](/organizations/mortis-lux) requires their direct assistance. The party expresses that they had hoped for more assistance than only the three of them, but were happy to have them fight for the cause.


## Titan Slaying
After discussing the immediate threat of the Ithilids, Spoops asks Odin about his experience in battle. To this, Odin tells him of how he led many of the battles against the Titans, becoming and expert in killing them. Spoops tells Odin of his control over [Tu'narath](/locations/tunarath) and his responsibility to defeat [Iapetus](/characters/iapetus) once this war is finished. Odin offers to train Mortis Lux in slaying Titans once the Ithilids are defeated. 

The party thanks the Norse Gods for their hospitality before departing for [Mortis Lux HQ](/locations/mortis-lux-hq) for their final preparations.
