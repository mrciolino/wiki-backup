[Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) and [Breezy-E](/characters/breezy) convene at the dragon sanctuary on [Mortis Lux HQ](/locations/mortis-lux-hq) to create the first dragon of the Spaghetti element.


## Birth of The Dragon
[Tony Mozzarella](/characters/Tony-Mozzarella) is chosen as the one to be reborn as a dragon. Breezy-E and Adalynn escort him to the dragon sanctuary where they begin the ritual. Once everything is in place, Adalynn casts her 10th level spell, [Dragon Birth](/Spells/Dragon-Birth). Tony Mozzarella has his soul drawn into a dragon egg. From this dragon egg he is born anew as the first Spaghetti dragon.
