The following is excerpts from material that was scryed by seers in [Fywick](/locations/Mardun/Fywick) corresponded with notes of dark magic research from mages in [Kaltrosar](/locations/Mardun/Kaltrosar) and ancient artifacts dug up along the shores of the [Witchlight Jungle]. 

## Introduction
It has come to the interest of Vrintia to learn and study the root cause of the existence of dark magic in the world if we are to best understand it, so to defeat it. This research has taken decades of work in scouring obscure sources and texts, and even longer for seers to scry out hidden knowledge on this matter. All evidence points to the formation of dark magic on Mardun during the end of the Age of Dragons in the reign of the Pythagorean Empire by a protomage named Asmal Karmir Ar-Shulma, colloquially named Asmal the Mad in other texts. This is the most comprehensive work on the subject as no other work exists, for we have encountered powerful forces that do not wish this information to be known upon us. Many have suffered and died in the gathering, translating, and interpreting of this information which I now present to you so that we may learn to defeat our true enemy.

# The Desolation of Asmal
> Taken from recovered artifacts in the Witchlight Jungle, information decursed and translated from Py.

I seek the truth and nothing less. For this I was imprisoned for 80 years. 80 years they spoke only in lies, for they did not want to hear with ears that hear, or see with eyes that see. But now the truth has set me free. The truth will save and destroy them. The truth will save and destroy us. Soon all will be destroyed and only the truth will remain. The truth I've carried in my mind for 80 years must be set out into the world.

> Scryer's note: This was written by Asmal himself, who had been imprisoned in a large structure of great importance to the Pythagorean Empire along the Leyline of Insight. Attacks by dragon forces on said structure allowed Asmal to escape his cell.

> Taken from engravings on an ancient quarterstaff found in the Shazanarg Mountains

We move, though the lines no longer. Asmal Karmir Ar-Shulma. We guide you to the end. The world will dance free again.

> Scryer's notes: Asmal was found by line walkers, a nomadic group that followed the leylines of old. The end is in reference to the opposite end of the leylines, known as the Antipodes, the farthest point on Mardun from Pythas Prime.

> The following is taken from a seer from Fywick who sailed into the middle of the Triangle Sea as a means to witness events long ago.

I bear witness to the trial of Asmal Karmir Ar-Shulma by Chief Justice Qatul.
