# Glub Glub Mind Controls Bazzdos
Bazzdos travels through Spoops' stomach to the elemental plane of water where Glub Glub mind controls him and attempts to steal laser technology.

Upon returning to Mortis lux HQ, Spoops returns to normal size as he steps through the gate. Instead of leaving Spoops' ribcage, he gets curious about Spoops' leather stomach and goes in. He is transported to the elemental plane of water where Glub Glub lives. 
- Glub Glub finds Bazzdos and mind controls him, forcing him to serve. Through speaking to Bazzdos, Glub Glub finds out about Bazz' new lasers, so he demands Bazzdos gice some to him.
- Bazzdos mounts some lasers on Glub Glub's claw.
- Upon realising Bazzdos went in his stomach, and finding him unresponsive via speaking stone, the party gate to the plane of eater to retrieve him. Upon arrival, Glub Glub tries to blast the party with a laser, Spoops redirects Glub Glub's laser back at him, knocking it off his claw. 
- Glub Glub's claw is blasted off, but he quickly grows a new one. 
- Adalynn mind blanks Bazzdos, removing Glub Glub's control.
- The party battle Glub Glub and kill him, however, like a hydra, when one dies two more appear. They manage to wipe out the Glub Glubs in the area and return home before more come for them.
