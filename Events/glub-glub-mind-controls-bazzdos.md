# Glub Glub Mind Controls Bazzdos
[Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos) travels through [Spoops'](/characters/spoops) stomach to the [elemental plane of water](/locations/elemental-plane-of-water) where [Glub Glub](/characters/glub-glub) mind controls him and attempts to steal laser technology.


## Through Spoops' Stomach
Upon returning to [Mortis lux HQ](/locations/mortis-lux-hq), Spoops returns to normal size as he steps through the gate. Instead of leaving Spoops' ribcage, Bazzdos gets curious about Spoops' leather stomach and goes in. He is transported to the elemental plane of water where Glub Glub lives. 


## Glub Glub Controls Bazzdos
Glub Glub finds Bazzdos and mind controls him, forcing him to serve. Through speaking to Bazzdos, Glub Glub finds out about Bazz' new lasers, so he demands Bazzdos give some to him.

Bazzdos mounts some lasers on Glub Glub's claw.


## The Party Retrieve Bazzdos
Upon realising Bazzdos went in his stomach, and finding him unresponsive via speaking stone, the party gate to the plane of water to retrieve him. Upon arrival, Glub Glub tries to blast the party with a laser, Spoops redirects Glub Glub's laser back at him, knocking it off his claw. 

Glub Glub's claw is blasted off, but he quickly grows a new one. 

[Adalynn](/characters/adalynn) mind blanks Bazzdos, removing Glub Glub's control.

The party battle Glub Glub and kill him, however, like a hydra, when one dies two more appear. They manage to wipe out the Glub Glubs in the area and return home before more come for them.
