# Fighting Cultists in Demsford
The party arrives in Demsford and tracks down the cultists.


## Rallying The Mob
On their way into the village, the party are greeted by desicated corpses strung up on crosses, these were some of the villagers. The party then immediately sees an orphan boy and talk to him his name is Teddy and his parents were killed by the cult. Our heroes then go to the bar and meet up with Spoops. They rally the villagers into a mob to kick the cult out of town. with the party at the head of the mob, every cultist they find is cut down except for one as he will be used to lead the team to the cultist fortress.


## The Cultist's Fortress
After a couple of hours trekking through the woods, the party arrive just outside the fortress, and run into a cultist patrol. One of the patroling cultists run into view and then is turned into a pile of goo by Bazzert's acid arrow. Bazzert would repeat this trick on their guide cultist to get rid of loose ends. However loose ends were no longer the focus as there was an entire fortress of cultists to fight. 

Krorg and bomb mount the battlements and start slaughtering the cultists, Os and Spoops charge the front gate while on horseback taking out a couple of enemies, but sustaining major damage. Bazzert and Drakham do a few things like arguing and turning into gas, but besides that not a whole lot. The battle quickly takes a turn for the worse as every cultist comes over to fight the would be defilers (the party), Krorg and Bomb get pinned down by a crossbow and magic barrage while the rest of the team is following behind.
