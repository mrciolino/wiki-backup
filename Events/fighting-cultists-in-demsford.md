# Fighting Cultists in Demsford
The party arrives in Demsford and tracks down the cultists.


## Rallying The Mob
On their way into the village, the party are greeted by desicated corpses strung up on crosses, these were some of the villagers. The party then immediately sees an orphan boy and talk to him his name is Teddy and his parents were killed by the cult. Our heroes then go to the bar and meet up with Spoops. They rally the villagers into a mob to kick the cult out of town. with the party at the head of the mob, every cultist they find is cut down except for one as he will be used to lead the team to the cultist fortress.


## The Cultist's Fortress
After a couple of hours trekking through the woods, the party arrive just outside the fortress, and run into a cultist patrol. One of the patroling cultists run into view and then is turned into a pile of goo by Bazzert's acid arrow. Bazzert would repeat this trick on their guide cultist to get rid of loose ends. However loose ends were no longer the focus as there was an entire fortress of cultists to fight. 

Krorg and bomb mount the battlements and start slaughtering the cultists, Os and Spoops charge the front gate while on horseback taking out a couple of enemies, but sustaining major damage. Bazzert and Drakham do a few things like arguing and turning into gas, but besides that not a whole lot. The battle quickly takes a turn for the worse as every cultist comes over to fight the would be defilers (the party), Krorg and Bomb get pinned down by a crossbow and magic barrage while the rest of the team is following behind.


## The Drakham Plan
Drakham proposes his first plan whoch is to retreat and wait until the cultists aren't alert and then break in by making holes in their wall and kill them all group by group instead of a frontal assault against all of them at once.

However the cult fortress already has holes in its walls and Krorg and Bomb would eventually die if left alone to fight all the cultists by themselves. 

## The Second Drakham Plan
Drakham proposes a second plan to ride around the side of the fortress and flank the cultists on horseback like a mini cavalry charge and saving Krorg and Bomb.

This plan while a bit better also failed as one of the cultist ran to get his boss. During the time before the cultist boss shows up Bazzert is attack by the fortress firing squad and gets struck by crossbow bolts and fire bolts and falls unconscious in a burning tree, good thing Frederina stopped the flames from burning Bazzert alive and pulling him from the tree. 


## Veerian Rathwing Arrives
Bazzert is now pulling a lot of weight and starts obliterating the cultists with lightning and moonbeams, thinning out the firing squad targeting Krorg and Bomb. 

However Krorg and Bomb have bigger issues now as Veerian animates 5 gold coins from his pocket and sends them to attack Bomb. The coins brutalize Bomb and Bomb falls unconscious after a tiring fight being pin-cushioned by cultist crossbows, burned by firebolts and now he succumbs to the coins. Everyone now focuses on Rathwing as the cultists are all dead except for two, and those who decided to run rather than die. 

In the ensuing battle Krorg throws his trident into the side of Rathwing and then pulls Rathwing from the air down over the fortress walls. The rest of the team closes in for the kill but Rathwing goes invisible and attacks the team from the shadows. A fireball strikes Spoops and Drakham causing Drakham to fall but Spoops gives chase toward the direction of the attack. Rathwing fails to blind Spoops and he casts detect good and evil now seeing Rathwing's evil aura.


## Bomb The Bear Dies
Not knowing Bomb was just slain, Krorg runs to aid Drakham, breaking two of the five animated gold coins on his way as Drakham is dying on the ground. Spoops continues to battle an invisible Rathwing and Bazzert attacks Rathwing with his Moonbeam but also Scorching Spoops with the holy moonfire which causes Spoops to fall unconcious. Krorg helps Drakham who pulls out some wild magic and absorbs the life force of the animated coins, and some of Krorgs, and rises from near death like a phoenix. Quickly after this Rathwing disengages from the fight and says "You are all vermin who aren't worth my time and these peasants are useless, I've already got what I wanted. Au revoir" Rathwing disappears and moments later Krorg sees him flying away westward over the hills and trees.

Krorg now goes back to where Bomb was lying on the ground and discovers that bomb is dead. He and Drakham are greatly saddened by this loss and move him to the riverside to bury him. Meanwhile Bazzert decides to try and decipher his book and is able to just read the first line in the the book... "How to kill Gods"
