# Spoops' Ascention
[Spoops](/characters/spoops) unites with his divine ego Ry-ann, restoring himself to godhood once again.

## Ascending to Godhood 
After landing in the floating island kingdom with half dragon people, Spoops goes to meet the locals and see what's the deal with this place.

Then [Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos), [Adalynn](/characters/adalynn), and [Os](/characters/os) are sent to the floating island dragon kingdom where Spoops and [Elira](/characters/elira) are currently. 

The party reunites in front of the gates to the castle where Spoops prays to His Divine Self Ry-ann and uses the 12th level spell [Divine Command](/Spells/Divine-Command) on himself to re-merge his split being into one.

Then the party is quickly presented by some guards before [Faaspraanaam](/characters/faaspraanaam) a huge double headed Purple Dragon, apparently the son of [Bahamut](/characters/bahamut) and [Tiamat](/characters/tiamat). After some questioning, Faaspraanaam's initial hostility subsides after the party agrees to leave, and so they do without any further incidents.

Before departing, Os tells Spoops that to make peace with the Gods, they want him to cease any attempts to ascend. Spoops tells Os its too late because he just ascended 5 minutes ago. The party then returns back to [Mardun](/locations/Mardun).
