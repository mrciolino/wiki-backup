# Spoops' Ascention
Spoops unites with his divine ego Ry-ann, restoring himself to godhood once again.

## Spoops' Ascention 
After landing in the floating island kingdom with half dragon people Spoops goes to meet the locals and see what's the deal with this place.

Then Bazzdows, Adalynn, and Os are sent to the floating island dragon kingdom where Spoops and Elira are currently. 

The party reunites in front of the gates to the castle where Spoops is praying to His Divine Self Ry-ann and uses the 12th level spell Divine Command on himself to re-merge his split being into one.

Then the party is quickly presented by some guards before Faaspraanaam a huge double headed Purple Dragon, apparently the son of Bahamut and Tiamat. After some questioning Faaspraanaam's initial hostility subsides after the party agrees to leave, and so they do without any further incidents.

Before departing, Os tells Spoops that to make peace with the Gods, they want him to cease any attempts to ascend. Spoops tells Os its too late because he just ascended 5 minutes ago. The party then returns back to Mardun.
