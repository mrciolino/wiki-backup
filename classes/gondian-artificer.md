# Warforged Gondian Artificer

***Prerequisite**: Warforged*
***Source**: Original design by [Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos).*

Forged by the legendary artificer Bazzdos, the Gondian Warforged are living constructs who embody the perfection of tool mastery, the power of the forge, and the genius of magical communication. These mechanized **artificers have integrated workshops, communication arrays, or fabrication systems directly into their bodies**, becoming living embodiments of their chosen craft and architects of construct civilization. When you select this subclass at 3rd level, you gain the following features:

**🔨 Proficiencies**: You gain proficiency with one set of artisan's tools of your choice. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency with another type of artisan's tools of your choice.
**🧰 Crafting**: You can craft both non-magical and magical items using your chosen artisan’s tools, provided you have the necessary materials, time, and tool proficiency. Crafting speed, cost, and difficulty vary based on item complexity and rarity.
**🏛️ Community Buildings**: Your body houses a deployable framework for constructing modular machines, each representing a facility tied to your subclass specialization. These buildings provide powerful area-based effects and scale with your progression. 

## Spells

You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Gondian Warforged Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you and do not count against your prepared spells.

| Spell Level | 3rd Level  | 5th Level    | 9th Level  | 13th Level   | 17th Level |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Spell 1     | *Identify* | *TBD*        | *TBD*      | *Fabricate*  | *Creation* |
| Spell 2     | *Shield*   | *Misty Step* | *Tiny Hut* | *Arcane Eye* | *TBD*      |


# ⚙️ Specialized Integration

At each **upgrade level (3, 5, 9, 15)**, you may select one upgrade from any pathway. **You must start at the beginning of a pathway and progress in order** (e.g., you cannot take a 9th-level Forge Master upgrade without first taking the 3rd- and 5th-level Forge Master upgrades). At 20th level, you may select two additional upgrades, bringing your total to six.

**🔥 Forge Master**: Deploys a specialized foundry for crafting superior armor, weapons, and defensive systems. Focuses on heavy construction and protective enchantments, excelling in defense and precision forging.
**⚡ Fabricator**: Integrates advanced manufacturing systems for rapid creation of constructs, mechanisms, and devices. Specializes in automation, traps, and mass production.
**📡 Support Network**: Installs communication arrays and projection systems to deliver tactical support, data sharing, and battlefield coordination across vast ranges.

In addition to your subclass path, **⚙️ Unit Enhancement** allows you to construct mechanical upgrades for your deployable unit. These enhancements require time, materials, and successful checks to build, but reward dedicated engineers with powerful functionality and custom utility.

## Crafting Time and Cost Calculation Guide 
This guide explains how to calculate the time and cost required to craft items using your artisan tools, based on item rarity, character stats, upgrades, and teamwork.

  </summary>
  
### Step-by-Step Crafting Time Calculation

1. **Start with Base Time**: From the rarity table above.
2. **Tool Proficiency**: If lacking, multiply time by **1.5**.
3. **Workshop Access**: If missing, multiply time by **1.25**.
4. **INT Modifier Reduction**: Subtract **5% per INT point above +1**.
5. **Proficiency Bonus Reduction**: Subtract **5% per PB point above +2**.
6. **Infrastructure Network Effects**: Apply bonuses from available structures in your specialized path.
7. **Gondian Path Upgrades**: Apply specific upgrade bonuses for your specialized items.
8. **Number of Artisans**: Divide time by **number of proficient helpers**.
9. **Round Up**: Always round the final time **up to the nearest full day**.

    
### **Example: Crafting a Rare Magic Item (Flame Tongue Sword)**

  * **Character**: Gondian Warforged Artificer, Level 9 - Forge Master Path
  * **INT Modifier**: +4
  * **Proficiency Bonus**: +4
  * **Tool Proficiencies**: Smith's tools (✔️)
  * **Infrastructure**: Advanced Shrine + 2 Basic Shrines in network
  * **Gondian Upgrade**: Divine Anvil (craft holy weapons 3× faster)
  * **Artisans Assisting**: 2 other proficient artisans
 
  
### 🧮 **Calculation Steps**

1. **Base Time (Rare Item)**
   → From table: **8 weeks**

2. **Tool Proficiency**
   → ✔️ Has it: **No modifier**

3. **Workshop Access**
   → ✔️ Yes: **No modifier**

4. **INT Modifier (+4)**
   → +3 over +1 → **3 × 5% = -15%**

5. **Proficiency Bonus (+4)**
   → +2 over +2 → **2 × 5% = -10%**

6. **Forge Master Infrastructure Network**
   → **-15% time** (Sacred Structure network bonus)

7. **Gondian Upgrade: Divine Anvil**
   → **×0.33 time** (craft holy weapons three times faster)

8. **Multiple Artisans**
   → 3 total artisans → **÷3**

### 🧾 **Math Breakdown**

**Start: 8 weeks**
→ Apply -15% (INT) → `8 × 0.85 = 6.8` weeks
→ Apply -10% (PB) → `6.8 × 0.9 = 6.12` weeks
→ Apply -15% (Infrastructure) → `6.12 × 0.85 = 5.2` weeks
→ Apply ×0.33 (Divine Anvil) → `5.2 × 0.33 = 1.72` weeks
→ Apply ÷3 (artisans) → `1.72 ÷ 3 = 0.57` weeks

→ **Final Time: ⏳ 4 days** (0.57 weeks rounded up)

### 💰 **Cost**

* Base Cost (Rare) = **2,500 gp**
* Final Cost = **2,500 gp**
* Crafting Cost (50%) = **1,250 gp**

### ✅ **Summary**

The holy Flame Tongue Sword takes **4 days** to craft at a cost of **1,250 gp**, thanks to high INT, divine workshop access, Sacred Structure network bonuses, Divine Anvil upgrade specialization, and artisan teamwork.
