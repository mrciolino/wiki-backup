# Warforged Gondian Artificer
***Prerequisite**: Warforged*
***Source**: Original design by [Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos).*

Forged by the legendary artificer Bazzdos, the Gondian Warforged are living constructs who embody the perfection of tool mastery, the power of the forge, and the genius of magical communication. These mechanized **artificers have integrated workshops, communication arrays, or flight systems directly into their bodies**, becoming living embodiments of their chosen craft and architects of construct civilization. When you select this subclass at the thrid level you gain the following improvements.

**🔨 Proficiencies**: You gain proficiency with one set of artisan's tools of your choice. If you already have this tool proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice. 
**🧰 Crafting**: You can craft both non-magical and magical items using your chosen artisan’s tools, provided you have the necessary materials, time, and tool proficiency. Crafting speed, cost, and difficulty vary by item complexity and rarity.
**🏛️ Community Buildings**: You can build shrines, facilities, and support structures for warforged and constructs. Projects require tool proficiency, materials, labor, and 5 successful checks (DC 12–20). Failed checks alternate between +25% cost and +25% time. Your specialized integration unlocks specific structures that can be constructed.

## Spells

You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Gondian Warforged Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

| Spell Level | 3rd Level  | 5th Level    | 9th Level  | 13th Level   | 17th Level             |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| Spell 1     | *Identify* | *TBD* | *TBD*  | *Fabricate*  | *Creation*             |
| Spell 2     | *Shield*   | *Misty Step* | *Tiny Hut* | *Arcane Eye* | *TBD* |


# ⚙️ Specialized Integration 
At each **upgrade level (3, 5, 9, 15)**, you may select any one upgrade from any pathway. **However, you must start at the beginning of a pathway and progress in order** (e.g., you cannot take a 9th-level Forge Master upgrade unless you have taken the 3rd and 5th-level Forge Master upgrades). At the 20th level, you may select 2 additional upgrades to complete your evolution for a total of 6 upgrades.

**🔥 Forge Master**: Deploys a specialized foundry for crafting superior armor, weapons, and defensive systems. Masters heavy construction and protective enchantments, excelling in defense and single-target crafting.

**⚡ Fabricator**: Houses advanced manufacturing systems for rapid creation of constructs, mechanisms, and technological devices. Specializes in automation, traps, and mass production capabilities.

**📡 Support Network**: Integrates communication arrays and holographic projectors to provide tactical support, information sharing, and battlefield coordination across vast distances.
Here is the upgraded markdown with **two bullet points max per upgrade** while preserving clarity and balance:

## Crafting Time and Cost Calculation Guide 
This guide explains how to calculate the time and cost required to craft items using your artisan tools, based on item rarity, character stats, upgrades, and teamwork.

**👇 Click to View Guide 👇**
  </summary>
  
### Step-by-Step Crafting Time Calculation

1. **Start with Base Time**: From the rarity table above.
2. **Tool Proficiency**: If lacking, multiply time by **1.5**.
3. **Workshop Access**: If missing, multiply time by **1.25**.
4. **INT Modifier Reduction**: Subtract **5% per INT point above +1**.
5. **Proficiency Bonus Reduction**: Subtract **5% per PB point above +2**.
6. **Infrastructure Network Effects**: Apply bonuses from available structures in your specialized path.
7. **Gondian Path Upgrades**: Apply specific upgrade bonuses for your specialized items.
8. **Number of Artisans**: Divide time by **number of proficient helpers**.
9. **Round Up**: Always round the final time **up to the nearest full day**.

    
### **Example: Crafting a Rare Magic Item (Flame Tongue Sword)**

  * **Character**: Gondian Warforged Artificer, Level 9 - Forge Master Path
  * **INT Modifier**: +4
  * **Proficiency Bonus**: +4
  * **Tool Proficiencies**: Smith's tools (✔️)
  * **Infrastructure**: Advanced Shrine + 2 Basic Shrines in network
  * **Gondian Upgrade**: Divine Anvil (craft holy weapons 3× faster)
  * **Artisans Assisting**: 2 other proficient artisans
 
  
### 🧮 **Calculation Steps**

1. **Base Time (Rare Item)**
   → From table: **8 weeks**

2. **Tool Proficiency**
   → ✔️ Has it: **No modifier**

3. **Workshop Access**
   → ✔️ Yes: **No modifier**

4. **INT Modifier (+4)**
   → +3 over +1 → **3 × 5% = -15%**

5. **Proficiency Bonus (+4)**
   → +2 over +2 → **2 × 5% = -10%**

6. **Forge Master Infrastructure Network**
   → **-15% time** (Sacred Structure network bonus)

7. **Gondian Upgrade: Divine Anvil**
   → **×0.33 time** (craft holy weapons three times faster)

8. **Multiple Artisans**
   → 3 total artisans → **÷3**

### 🧾 **Math Breakdown**

**Start: 8 weeks**
→ Apply -15% (INT) → `8 × 0.85 = 6.8` weeks
→ Apply -10% (PB) → `6.8 × 0.9 = 6.12` weeks
→ Apply -15% (Infrastructure) → `6.12 × 0.85 = 5.2` weeks
→ Apply ×0.33 (Divine Anvil) → `5.2 × 0.33 = 1.72` weeks
→ Apply ÷3 (artisans) → `1.72 ÷ 3 = 0.57` weeks

→ **Final Time: ⏳ 4 days** (0.57 weeks rounded up)

### 💰 **Cost**

* Base Cost (Rare) = **2,500 gp**
* Final Cost = **2,500 gp**
* Crafting Cost (50%) = **1,250 gp**

### ✅ **Summary**

The holy Flame Tongue Sword takes **4 days** to craft at a cost of **1,250 gp**, thanks to high INT, divine workshop access, Sacred Structure network bonuses, Divine Anvil upgrade specialization, and artisan teamwork.
