# Warforged Gondian Artificer
*Prerequisite: Warforged*

Forged by the legendary artificer Bazzdos, the Gondian Warforged are living constructs who embody the perfection of tool mastery, the power of the forge, and the genius of magical communication. These mechanized artificers have integrated workshops, communication arrays, or fabrication systems directly into their bodies, becoming living embodiments of their chosen craft.

## Tool Proficiency

Proficiencies: You gain proficiency with one set of artisan's tools of your choice. If you already have this tool proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice. 

Crafting: You can now craft non-magical and magical items using your chosen artisan's tools. Follow the crafting rules at the bottom of this page.

## Gondian Warforged Spells (3rd Level)

You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Gondian Warforged Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

| Artificer Level | Spells |
|-----------------|--------|
| 3rd | *Identify*, *Shield* |
| 5th | *Heat Metal*, *Misty Step* |
| 9th | *Sending*, *Tiny Hut* |
| 13th | *Fabricate*, *Arcane Eye* |
| 17th | *Creation*, *Teleportation Circle* |

# Specialized Integration 
At each **upgrade level (3, 5, 9, 15)**, you may select any one upgrade from any pathway. **However, you must start at the beginning of a pathway and progress in order** (e.g., you cannot take a 9th-level Fabricator upgrade unless you have taken the 3rd and 5th-level Fabricator upgrades). At 20th level, you may select 2 additional upgrades to complete your evolution. 

* **Forge Master**: Wields a deployable workshop embedded in their body, excelling in metalwork, melee support, and defensive utility through enhanced crafting and magical reinforcement.
* **Network Architect**: Integrates a communication tower to enable telepathic messaging, battlefield surveillance, and wide-area control using arcane signal manipulation.
* **Fabricator**: Houses a compact workshop for rapid creation of tools, traps, and constructs, specializing in on-the-fly invention and adaptive problem-solving.
