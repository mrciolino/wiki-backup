# Warforged Gondian Artificer

***Prerequisite**: Warforged*
***Source**: Original design by [Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos).*

Forged by the legendary artificer Bazzdos, the Gondian Warforged are living constructs who embody tool mastery, the power of the forge, and the genius of magical communication. These mechanized **artificers have integrated workshops, communication arrays, or fabrication systems directly into their bodies**, becoming living embodiments of their craft and architects of construct civilization. When you select this subclass at 3rd level, you gain the following features:

**üß∞ Tool Proficiencies**: You gain proficiency with one set of artisan's tools of your choice. If you already have this proficiency, choose another type instead.
**üî® Crafting Ability**: You can craft magical and non-magical items using your artisan‚Äôs tools, given the right materials, time, and proficiency. Speed, cost, and difficulty scale with item rarity‚Äîsee [Gondian Crafting](/classes/gondian-artificer) for details.
**‚öôÔ∏è Specialized Integration**: Your body houses a deployable framework for constructing upgradable machines, each representing a facility tied to your subclass specialization.

## Spells

Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Gondian Artificer Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don‚Äôt count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

| **Gondian Artificer Spells** |                                   |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Artificer Level**          | **Gondian Artificer Spells**      |
| 3rd Level                    | *Identify*, *Shield*              |
| 5th Level                    | *Mirror Image*, *Misty Step*      |
| 9th Level                    | *Glyph of Warding*, *Tiny Hut*    |
| 13th Level                   | *Fabricate*, *Arcane Eye*         |
| 17th Level                   | *Creation*, *Wall of Force*       |


# ‚öôÔ∏è Specialized Integration

At each **upgrade level (3, 5, 9, 15)**, you can choose **one upgrade from any path**, but must **start at the 3rd-level upgrade** of that path and follow its progression. *(For example, you could take the 3rd-level Forge Master upgrade at level 3, the 3rd-level Fabricator upgrade at level 5, then continue the Forge Master level 5 and 9 upgrades at levels 9 and 15).* At 20th level, you gain **two more upgrades**, for a total of six.

**üî• Forge Master**: Deploys a specialized foundry for crafting superior armor, weapons, and defensive systems. Excels in heavy construction and protective enchantments.
**‚ö° Fabricator**: Integrates advanced manufacturing systems for rapid creation of constructs, mechanisms, and devices. Specializes in automation, traps, and mass production.
**üì° Support Network**: Installs communication arrays and projection systems to deliver tactical support, data sharing, and battlefield coordination across vast ranges.

In addition to your subclass path, **Unit Enhancements** let you engineer mechanical upgrades for your deployable unit‚Äîeach requiring time, materials, and skill checks. To succeed, you must pass 5 checks above the listed DC; failed rolls increase total time and cost by 10% each. *(e.g., if it takes 7 Arcana checks to get 5 above DC 15, time and cost increase by 20%).*

## Level 20: Master of Invention

**Gondian Master:** You have achieved ultimate mastery as a Bazzdos-style Gondian Warforged, integrating multiple disciplines into your living design. **Select 2 more upgrades**, respecting the same rules as above. At this point you should have **6 total upgrades**.

**Gondian Core:** You can now build a legendary Gondian Core - a **Community Building** that fuses the forge, the factory, and the arcane relay. This empowers constructs and allies within 1 mile with unmatched coordination, defense, and productivity.

# üèõÔ∏è Community Buildings
As your skills advance, you can construct Community Buildings, large-scale structures that enhance towns or strongholds with path-specific benefits. Only **one building per Specialized Integration may be active** in a given area. Each requires time, labor, materials, and 5 successful checks above the listed DC; failed rolls add 10% to both time and cost per failure. (e.g., if it takes 7 Arcana checks to get 5 above an Arcana DC 15, time and cost increase by 20%). Each building must be staffed full time by **at least 2 skilled artisans** for their effects to be active.

| Structure | Requirement | Time | Cost | Check | Effect |
| --------- | ----------- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| <nobr>**üî• Crucible Hall** | Level 15+   | 12 weeks | 6,000 gp | 5x Smith‚Äôs Tools DC 23     | A fortified industrial facility for advanced metallurgy and structural enhancement.<br><br>**Allies and local structures within 1 mile gain:**<br>**Reinforced architecture:** +5 AC to buildings and siege defenses. <br>**Forgemaster‚Äôs rhythm:** smithing and weapon crafting time is halved, and grants +2 to  Artisian tool checks. |

(1/day) |
  
## Gondian Core
Once all three Community Buildings have been constructed, you may begin the ultimate synthesis project‚Äîan intelligent, regional hub that merges forge, factory, and network. This requires collaboration amongst many Gondian Warforged, establishing a community and enhancing collective efficiency. This center of operations must be staffed by **at least 3 skilled artisans** for its effects to be active.

| Structure | Requirement | Time | Cost | Check | Effect |
| --------- | ----------- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| <nobr>**üß† Gondian Core** | All Community Buildings Complete | 1 year | 30,000 gp | 5x (Smith Tools or Artificer's Tools or Arcana) DC 25 | The Core acts as a regional command and development center, capable of coordinating large-scale efforts or defenses with illusion support, deployable constructs, and crafting logistics.<br><br>**Allies and constructs within 1 mile benefit from:**<br> **Preparedness:** +1 AC, +1 initiative, and advantage on concentration checks. <br>**Shared knowledge stream:** any creature can use a bonus action to send information to another construct within 1 mile of core (prof. bonus/short rest). <br>**Resource acceleration:** all crafting projects require 25% less time and cost 25% less to craft.|
