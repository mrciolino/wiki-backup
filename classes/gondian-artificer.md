# Warforged Gondian Artificer
*Prerequisite: Warforged*

Forged by the legendary artificer Bazzdos, the Gondian Warforged are living constructs who embody the perfection of tool mastery, the power of the forge, and the genius of magical communication. These mechanized **artificers have integrated workshops, communication arrays, or flight systems directly into their bodies**, becoming living embodiments of their chosen craft and architects of construct civilization.

## Tool Proficiency

**🔨 Proficiencies**: You gain proficiency with one set of artisan's tools of your choice. If you already have this tool proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice. 
**🧰 Crafting**: You can now craft non-magical and magical items using your chosen artisan's tools. Follow the **Crafting Rules** at the bottom of this page.
**🏛️ Community Building**: You can construct sacred shrines, community structures, and maintenance facilities that benefit warforged and construct communities. See the **Community Infrastructure** section below.

## Specialized Integration 
At each **upgrade level (3, 5, 9, 15)**, you may select any one upgrade from any pathway. **However, you must start at the beginning of a pathway and progress in order** (e.g., you cannot take a 9th-level Fabricator upgrade unless you have taken the 3rd and 5th-level Fabricator upgrades). At 20th level, you may select 2 additional upgrades to complete your evolution. 

* **🔥 Forge Master**: Wields a deployable workshop embedded in their body, excelling in metalwork, melee support, and defensive utility through enhanced crafting and magical reinforcement.
* **📡 Network Architect**: Integrates a communication tower to enable telepathic messaging, battlefield surveillance, and wide-area control using arcane signal manipulation.
* **⚡ Fabricator**: Houses a compact workshop for rapid creation of tools, traps, and constructs, specializing in on-the-fly invention and adaptive problem-solving.
