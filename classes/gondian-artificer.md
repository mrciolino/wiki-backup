# Warforged Gondian Artificer
*Prerequisite: Warforged*

Forged by the legendary artificer Bazzdos, the Gondian Warforged are living constructs who embody the perfection of tool mastery, the power of the forge, and the genius of magical communication. These mechanized **artificers have integrated workshops, communication arrays, or flight systems directly into their bodies**, becoming living embodiments of their chosen craft and architects of construct civilization.

## Tool Proficiency

**üî® Proficiencies**: You gain proficiency with one set of artisan's tools of your choice. If you already have this tool proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice. 
**üß∞ Crafting**: You can now craft non-magical and magical items using your chosen artisan's tools. Follow the **Crafting Rules** at the bottom of this page.
**üèõÔ∏è Community Building**: You can construct sacred shrines, community structures, and maintenance facilities that benefit warforged and construct communities. See the **Community Infrastructure** section below.

## Specialized Integration 
At each **upgrade level (3, 5, 9, 15)**, you may select any one upgrade from any pathway. **However, you must start at the beginning of a pathway and progress in order** (e.g., you cannot take a 9th-level Forge Master upgrade unless you have taken the 3rd and 5th-level Forge Master upgrades). At 20th level, you may select 2 additional upgrades to complete your evolution. 

**üî• Forge Master**: Wields a deployable workshop embedded in their body, excelling in metalwork, melee support, and defensive utility through enhanced crafting and magical reinforcement. Masters the construction of **Sacred Structures** that provide spiritual protection and divine crafting capabilities.
**üì° Network Architect**: Integrates a communication tower to enable telepathic messaging, battlefield surveillance, and wide-area control using arcane signal manipulation. Specializes in building **Communication Networks** that link communities across vast distances.
**‚ö° Fabricator**: Houses a compact workshop for rapid creation of tools, traps, and constructs, specializing in on-the-fly invention and adaptive problem-solving. Focuses on **Industrial Infrastructure** that supports mass production and automated systems.

## Spells

You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Gondian Warforged Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

## Step-by-Step Crafting Time Calculation

1. **Start with Base Time**: From the rarity table above.
2. **Tool Proficiency**: If lacking, multiply time by **1.5**.
3. **Workshop Access**: If missing, multiply time by **1.25**.
4. **INT Modifier Reduction**: Subtract **5% per INT point above +1**.
5. **Proficiency Bonus Reduction**: Subtract **5% per PB point above +2**.
6. **Infrastructure Network Effects**: Apply bonuses from available structures in your specialized path.
7. **Gondian Path Upgrades**: Apply specific upgrade bonuses for your specialized items.
8. **Number of Artisans**: Divide time by **number of proficient helpers**.
9. **Round Up**: Always round the final time **up to the nearest full day**.

### Example Crafting Calculation

<details>
	<summary> 
    
## üß™ **Example: Crafting a Rare Magic Item (Flame Tongue Sword)**

  * **Character**: Gondian Warforged Artificer, Level 9 - Forge Master Path
  * **INT Modifier**: +4
  * **Proficiency Bonus**: +4
  * **Tool Proficiencies**: Smith's tools (‚úîÔ∏è)
  * **Infrastructure**: Advanced Shrine + 2 Basic Shrines in network
  * **Gondian Upgrade**: Divine Anvil (craft holy weapons 3√ó faster)
  * **Artisans Assisting**: 2 other proficient artisans
 
  </summary>
  
### üßÆ **Calculation Steps**

1. **Base Time (Rare Item)**
   ‚Üí From table: **8 weeks**

2. **Tool Proficiency**
   ‚Üí ‚úîÔ∏è Has it: **No modifier**

3. **Workshop Access**
   ‚Üí ‚úîÔ∏è Yes: **No modifier**

4. **INT Modifier (+4)**
   ‚Üí +3 over +1 ‚Üí **3 √ó 5% = -15%**

5. **Proficiency Bonus (+4)**
   ‚Üí +2 over +2 ‚Üí **2 √ó 5% = -10%**

6. **Forge Master Infrastructure Network**
   ‚Üí **-15% time** (Sacred Structure network bonus)

7. **Gondian Upgrade: Divine Anvil**
   ‚Üí **√ó0.33 time** (craft holy weapons three times faster)

8. **Multiple Artisans**
   ‚Üí 3 total artisans ‚Üí **√∑3**

### üßæ **Math Breakdown**

**Start: 8 weeks**
‚Üí Apply -15% (INT) ‚Üí `8 √ó 0.85 = 6.8` weeks
‚Üí Apply -10% (PB) ‚Üí `6.8 √ó 0.9 = 6.12` weeks
‚Üí Apply -15% (Infrastructure) ‚Üí `6.12 √ó 0.85 = 5.2` weeks
‚Üí Apply √ó0.33 (Divine Anvil) ‚Üí `5.2 √ó 0.33 = 1.72` weeks
‚Üí Apply √∑3 (artisans) ‚Üí `1.72 √∑ 3 = 0.57` weeks

‚Üí **Final Time: ‚è≥ 4 days** (0.57 weeks rounded up)

### üí∞ **Cost**

* Base Cost (Rare) = **2,500 gp**
* Final Cost = **2,500 gp**
* Crafting Cost (50%) = **1,250 gp**

### ‚úÖ **Summary**

The holy Flame Tongue Sword takes **4 days** to craft at a cost of **1,250 gp**, thanks to high INT, divine workshop access, Sacred Structure network bonuses, Divine Anvil upgrade specialization, and artisan teamwork.
