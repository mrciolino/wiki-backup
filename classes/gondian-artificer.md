# Warforged Gondian Artificer

***Prerequisite**: Warforged*
***Source**: Original design by [Bazzdos](/characters/bazzdos).*

Forged by the legendary artificer Bazzdos, the Gondian Warforged are living constructs who embody the perfection of tool mastery, the power of the forge, and the genius of magical communication. These mechanized **artificers have integrated workshops, communication arrays, or fabrication systems directly into their bodies**, becoming living embodiments of their chosen craft and architects of construct civilization. When you select this subclass at 3rd level, you gain the following features:

**🧰 Tool Proficiencies**: You gain proficiency with one set of artisan's tools of your choice. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency with another type of artisan's tools of your choice.
**🔨 Crafting Ability**: You can craft both non-magical and magical items using your chosen artisan’s tools, provided you have the necessary materials, time, and tool proficiency. Crafting speed, cost, and difficulty vary based on item complexity and rarity.
**⚙️ Specialized Integration**: Your body houses a deployable framework for constructing upgradable machines, each representing a facility tied to your subclass specialization.

## Spells

You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class. These spells count as artificer spells for you and do not count against your prepared spells.

| Spell Level | 3rd Level  | 5th Level    | 9th Level  | 13th Level   | 17th Level |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Spell 1     | *Identify* | *TBD*        | *TBD*      | *Fabricate*  | *Creation* |
| Spell 2     | *Shield*   | *Misty Step* | *Tiny Hut* | *Arcane Eye* | *TBD*      |


# ⚙️ Specialized Integration

At each **upgrade level (3, 5, 9, 15)**, you can choose **one upgrade from any path**, but you must **start at the 3rd-level upgrade** of that path and follow its order—so you can switch paths at any upgrade level, but must always begin at that path’s 3rd-level upgrade. *(For example, you could take the 3rd-level Forge Master upgrade at level 3, the 3rd-level Fabricator upgrade at level 5, then continue the Fabricator path with its 5th- and 9th-level upgrades at levels 9 and 15).* At 20th level, you gain **two more upgrades**, for a total of six.


**🔥 Forge Master**: Deploys a specialized foundry for crafting superior armor, weapons, and defensive systems. Focuses on heavy construction and protective enchantments, excelling in defense and precision forging.
**⚡ Fabricator**: Integrates advanced manufacturing systems for rapid creation of constructs, mechanisms, and devices. Specializes in automation, traps, and mass production.
**📡 Support Network**: Installs communication arrays and projection systems to deliver tactical support, data sharing, and battlefield coordination across vast ranges.

In addition to your subclass path, **Unit Enhancements** let you engineer mechanical upgrades for your deployable unit—each requiring time, materials, and skill checks. To succeed, you must pass 5 checks above the listed DC; failed rolls increase total time and cost by 10% each. (e.g., if it takes 7 Arcana checks to get 5 above an Arcana DC 15, time and cost increase by 20%).

## Level 20: Master of Invention

**Gondian Master:** You have achieved ultimate mastery as a Bazzdos-style Gondian Warforged, integrating multiple disciplines into your living design. **Select 2 more upgrades**, respecting the same rules as above. At this point you should have 6 total upgrades.

**Community Buildings**: You can now construct an **Integrated Metropolis** that combines all three infrastructure types, providing community-wide benefits to all constructs and allies within a 1-mile radius and supporting populations of 10,000+ beings.

# 🏛️ Community Buildings
As your skills advance, you can construct Community Buildings, large-scale structures that enhance towns or strongholds with path-specific benefits. Only **one building per Specialized Integration may be active**, with the Gondian Core as the ultimate fusion of all systems. Each requires time, labor, materials, and 5 successful checks above the listed DC; failed rolls add 10% to both time and cost per failure. (e.g., if it takes 7 Arcana checks to get 5 above an Arcana DC 15, time and cost increase by 20%). These buildings must be staffed full time by **at least 2 skilled artisans** each for their effects to be active.

| Structure | Requirement | Time | Cost | Check | Effect |
| --------- | ----------- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| **🔥 Crucible Hall** | Level 15+    | 12 weeks | 6,000 gp | 5x Smithing Tools DC 23    | A fortified industrial facility. Grants +2 AC to all local structures, mass-produces basic weapons/armor weekly, and boosts blacksmith crafting speed. |
| **⚡ Constructory**   | Level 15+ | 12 weeks | 7,500 gp | 5x Artificer's Tools DC 23 | A full-scale mechanized works. Produces 2 Tiny or 1 Small autonomous constructs weekly for labor or defense, and enhances output of local fabrication workshops. |
| **📡 Signal Spire**  | Level 15+   | 12 weeks | 5,000 gp | 5x Arcana DC 17 | A centralized arcane tower for communications and coordination. Enables town-wide alerts, boosts initiative by +1, and grants advantage on defense coordination rolls within 1 mile. |

## Gondian Core
Once all three Community Buildings have been constructed, you may begin the ultimate synthesis project—an intelligent, regional hub that merges forge, factory, and network. This requires collaboration amongst many Gondian Warforged, establishing a community and enhancing collective efficiency. This center of operations must be staffed by **at least 3 skilled artisans** for its effects to be active.

| Structure | Requirement | Time | Cost | Check | Effect |
| --------- | ----------- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| **🧠 Gondian Core** | All Community Buildings Complete | 1 year | 30,000 gp | 5x Tools DC 25 | Combines all prior functions. Doubles all production rates, grants +4 AC to fortified structures, provides magical alert systems, and extends Support Network effects regionally. |

## Time and Cost Calculation Guide 
This guide explains how to calculate the time and cost required to craft items using your artisan tools, based on item rarity, character stats, upgrades, and teamwork.

  </summary>
  
### Step-by-Step Crafting Time Calculation

1. **Start with Base Time**: From the rarity table above.
2. **Tool Proficiency**: If lacking, multiply time by **1.5**.
3. **Workshop Access**: If missing, multiply time by **1.25**.
4. **INT Modifier Reduction**: Subtract **5% per INT point above +1**.
5. **Proficiency Bonus Reduction**: Subtract **5% per PB point above +2**.
6. **Infrastructure Network Effects**: Apply bonuses from available structures in your specialized path.
7. **Gondian Path Upgrades**: Apply specific upgrade bonuses for your specialized items.
8. **Number of Artisans**: Divide time by **number of proficient helpers**.
9. **Round Up**: Always round the final time **up to the nearest full day**.

    
### **Example: Crafting a Rare Magic Item (Flame Tongue Sword)**

  * **Character**: Gondian Warforged Artificer, Level 9 - Forge Master Path
  * **INT Modifier**: +4
  * **Proficiency Bonus**: +4
  * **Tool Proficiencies**: Smith's tools (✔️)
  * **Infrastructure**: Advanced Shrine + 2 Basic Shrines in network
  * **Gondian Upgrade**: Divine Anvil (craft holy weapons 3× faster)
  * **Artisans Assisting**: 2 other proficient artisans
 
  
### 🧮 **Calculation Steps**

1. **Base Time (Rare Item)**
   → From table: **8 weeks**

2. **Tool Proficiency**
   → ✔️ Has it: **No modifier**

3. **Workshop Access**
   → ✔️ Yes: **No modifier**

4. **INT Modifier (+4)**
   → +3 over +1 → **3 × 5% = -15%**

5. **Proficiency Bonus (+4)**
   → +2 over +2 → **2 × 5% = -10%**

6. **Forge Master Infrastructure Network**
   → **-15% time** (Sacred Structure network bonus)

7. **Gondian Upgrade: Divine Anvil**
   → **×0.33 time** (craft holy weapons three times faster)

8. **Multiple Artisans**
   → 3 total artisans → **÷3**

### 🧾 **Math Breakdown**

**Start: 8 weeks**
→ Apply -15% (INT) → `8 × 0.85 = 6.8` weeks
→ Apply -10% (PB) → `6.8 × 0.9 = 6.12` weeks
→ Apply -15% (Infrastructure) → `6.12 × 0.85 = 5.2` weeks
→ Apply ×0.33 (Divine Anvil) → `5.2 × 0.33 = 1.72` weeks
→ Apply ÷3 (artisans) → `1.72 ÷ 3 = 0.57` weeks

→ **Final Time: ⏳ 4 days** (0.57 weeks rounded up)

### 💰 **Cost**

* Base Cost (Rare) = **2,500 gp**
* Final Cost = **2,500 gp**
* Crafting Cost (50%) = **1,250 gp**

### ✅ **Summary**

The holy Flame Tongue Sword takes **4 days** to craft at a cost of **1,250 gp**, thanks to high INT, divine workshop access, Sacred Structure network bonuses, Divine Anvil upgrade specialization, and artisan teamwork.
