## Oath Spells

| Paladin Level | Spell(s) | Additional Spell Slots | 
|---------------|
-------------------|---------------------|
| 3rd | [Animate Dead](/spells/Animate-Dead), Sanctuary | 1 x 3rd level |
| 5th | Spirit Guardians, Inflict Wounds | | 
| 9th | Crusader's Mantle, Life Transference | | 
| 13th | Staggering Smite, Aura of Purity | | 
| 17th | Disintegrate | 1 x 6th level |


## Channel Divinity: Bind The Dead

### Modified Animate Dead
You can use your channel divinity to keep control of your undead servants when the spell controlling them would usually end. One use of channel divinity per spell used to control/raise the dead. 

The amount of undead you may maintain control over equals your level / 2, rounded down. When cast at a higher level, plus an additional undead for each spell slot above 3rd.

| Spell Slot Level | Additional Undead Controlled | 
|---------------|
----------------------------------|
| 3rd | 1 |
| 4th | 2 |
| 5th | 3 |
| 6th | 4 |

You are able to Raise and control different kinds of undead creatures. Depending on the quantity and state of the corpses used.
| Player Level | Type of Undead | Corpses Required | Details |
|--------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| 3rd | Zombie | 1 | |
| 3rd | Skeleton | 1 | |
| 6th | Wight | 3 | Each wight is sentient, can speak, and can animate/control an additional 6 undead from this same list. |
| 12th | Giant Skeleton | 20 | A Huge creature |


## Channel divinity: Restoration of The Soul
You may conduct a ritual and perform sacrifices of an appropriate value to Spoops to revitalize an undead body and restore their soul to their body. The creature comes back to life and is no longer under your control. Performing this ritual on a Wight or similar undead composed of miltiple corpses would first require disassembly of the creature and reassembly of the parts into individual corpses.

**Note: Spoops used to sacrifice random amounts of Gold and kill a phoenix each time he resurrected the dead, this is of course absurd considering hes the God of souls and can do what he wants, however some traditions carry on and while sacrificing a life for a life still makes no sense given the nature of the religion, a DM defined toll is required. (gotta fill the coffers of Mortis Lux! Illiard needs that gold!)



## Aura of Terror (7th Level)
Starting at 7th level, you constantly emanate a menacing aura while you're not incapacitated. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.

If a creature is hostile towards you or designated by you as targeted by the aura, they must roll a wisdom saving throw against your spell save dc, and if a creature is frightened of you, its speed is reduced to 0 while within range of the aura.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.


## Sacred Oath: Champion of The Dead (15th Level)
Once activated, this effect lasts 4 hours. 

Range 30ft.

All undead under your control and faithful followers of Spoops aligned with you range, gain additive bonuses equal to your charisma modifier to the following: 
- attack rolls
- attack damage
- skill checks
- health points gained from healing. 

To uphold this Oath you must continue to surround yourself with undead and loyal faithful followers of Spoops, or convert those who are not faithful. Recharges once per long rest.


## Order of The Soul Warden Secret Ability (20th Level)
As a Bonus Action, for one minute:
You take on the appearance of a gargantuan skeletal monstrosity appearing from a void of darkness, Frightening your enemies.

While this ability is active, you gain the following effects:
- Advantage on all attacks
- Resistance to all damage
- Aura benefits are doubled

You cannot use this ability again until you finish a long rest.


## Conversion Ceremony
Any person converting to the Faith of Spoops gains the blessing of a Death Ward upon the completion of their conversion.
