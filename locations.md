# Locations

[Allford](/locations/Alford)

## Fort Suro (Population 142)
Owes allegiance to the King of Kaltrazar Bay in the Kingdom of Kaltrazar, has an iron mine, located on the main road out of Kaltrazar Bay

- Starting location of the campaign.
- In the tavern, 12 of us (Nick, Michelle, Carson, Dan, Matt, Spoon, Sean, Cat, Breezy, Stef, Peter, Pope) met during Session 0.
- We were all called to meet a mysterious caller at the tavern (letters for a lucrative adventuring job) and sat down together.
- Stef stole from behind the bar and left the party.
- Spoops was choking Os (he was offended).
- Breezy E (a samurai) tried to call a tornado (not a spell) and rolled a Nat 1. This happened to Lucini.
- Kat got the guards (because of Spoops vs. Os, but the demon was there too). Now Spoops fought the guards alongside the demon and seduced the demon Lucini. A romantic moment ensues, and Lucini gives Spoops a weird stone with a glyph (alongside some vials of blood and hair).
- Otto Hurtzog didn’t like Os’s bard antics, so he fired an arrow and knocked Os unconscious. Trying to help Os, Freedom arrives to defend him. Freedom goes to fight Lucini (Lucini dies, but his body disappears) -> Lucini possesses Freedom before disappearing.
- We rest (SESSION 2, Lucini in Freedom’s body gives us a quest) to free some slaves, but Lucini tells us to ask the guard captain for help. The captain says to clear the iron mines of goblins.
- Spoops stops at a local church on the way to the mine but didn’t get the blessing he was looking for from the priests.
- We went into the iron mine, fought some goblins, and found Bomb the Bear in a chest. Os died to multiple arrows and getting hit by a minecart (however, Drakham does a wild magic surge and randomly gets resurrected - Os is the same race).
- Krorg suplexes Bomb the Bear into a chest and carries him out.
- The goblin captain on our way out rolls a cannon out and fires it at us, but we are still in the cave, so we dodge out of the way.
- We take the captain alive and stuff him into the cannon to bring him back to the guard. He says the merchant transport is going to a fishing village, and we join them on the journey.


## Galeton (Population 236)

- On the way to the village, some bandits attempt to rob us on the highway. Some party members sneak around and find the bandit stash. Os plays a song to distract the bandits.
- This is where Spoops gets the Wind Amulet and we discover a nature shrine with many badgers. Here, we meet Senior Gaurdison (father of the previous Gaurdison).
- The tavern in the fishing village is called "The Wispy Rat."
- We receive gold for protecting a merchant caravan.
- Kat, Os, and Drakham hang around the docks. Kat's patron, a yellow lobster, appears to Kat. A void portal opens, and Os and Drakham join Kat in jumping into the void, encountering lots of teeth and evil patron vibes.
- Federina accepts servitude to her patron. Os and Drakham agree to help her as well.
- The Wind Amulet needs to be recovered so Gaurdison can man the lighthouse, but Spoops really wants it. We go to get it; Drakham gets it first and places it in a lockbox at the nature shrine. Spoops breaks into the lockbox, angering the spirit who summons badgers. In response, Federina sets the forest on fire.
- Crow helps us stop the fire from burning the town. After that, we follow the merchant caravan to the big city, Kaltrazar Bay.
